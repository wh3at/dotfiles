# Hypothesis Table

| HID | Hypothesis | Prediction (if true, log shows...) | Log Points Needed |
|-----|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| H1  |            |                                     |                   |
| H2  |            |                                     |                   |
| H3  |            |                                     |                   |

## Notes

- Minimum 3 hypotheses required
- Each hypothesis must have a testable prediction
- Log points should discriminate between hypotheses
