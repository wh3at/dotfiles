* * API reference* Test Reporter* Reporter

On this page

Test runner notifies the reporter about various events during test execution. All methods of the reporter are optional.

You can create a custom reporter by implementing a class with some of the reporter methods. Make sure to export this class as default.

* TypeScript* JavaScript

my-awesome-reporter.ts

```
import type {
  Reporter, FullConfig, Suite, TestCase, TestResult, FullResult
} from '@playwright/test/reporter';

class MyReporter implements Reporter {
  constructor(options: { customOption?: string } = {}) {
    console.log(`my-awesome-reporter setup with customOption set to ${options.customOption}`);
  }

  onBegin(config: FullConfig, suite: Suite) {
    console.log(`Starting the run with ${suite.allTests().length} tests`);
  }

  onTestBegin(test: TestCase) {
    console.log(`Starting test ${test.title}`);
  }

  onTestEnd(test: TestCase, result: TestResult) {
    console.log(`Finished test ${test.title}: ${result.status}`);
  }

  onEnd(result: FullResult) {
    console.log(`Finished the run: ${result.status}`);
  }
}
export default MyReporter;
```

my-awesome-reporter.js

```
// @ts-check

/** @implements {import('@playwright/test/reporter').Reporter} */
class MyReporter {
  constructor(options) {
    console.log(`my-awesome-reporter setup with customOption set to ${options.customOption}`);
  }

  onBegin(config, suite) {
    console.log(`Starting the run with ${suite.allTests().length} tests`);
  }

  onTestBegin(test) {
    console.log(`Starting test ${test.title}`);
  }

  onTestEnd(test, result) {
    console.log(`Finished test ${test.title}: ${result.status}`);
  }

  onEnd(result) {
    console.log(`Finished the run: ${result.status}`);
  }
}

module.exports = MyReporter;
```

Now use this reporter with [testConfig.reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-reporter). Learn more about [using reporters](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters.html).

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [['./my-awesome-reporter.ts', { customOption: 'some value' }]],
});
```

Here is a typical order of reporter calls:

* [reporter.onBegin()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-begin) is called once with a root suite that contains all other suites and tests. Learn more about [suites hierarchy](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-suite.html "Suite").
* [reporter.onTestBegin()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-test-begin) is called for each test run. It is given a [TestCase](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testcase.html "TestCase") that is executed, and a [TestResult](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testresult.html "TestResult") that is almost empty. Test result will be populated while the test runs (for example, with steps and stdio) and will get final `status` once the test finishes.
* [reporter.onStepBegin()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-step-begin) and [reporter.onStepEnd()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-step-end) are called for each executed step inside the test. When steps are executed, test run has not finished yet.
* [reporter.onTestEnd()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-test-end) is called when test run has finished. By this time, [TestResult](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testresult.html "TestResult") is complete and you can use [testResult.status](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testresult.html#test-result-status), [testResult.error](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testresult.html#test-result-error) and more.
* [reporter.onEnd()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-end) is called once after all tests that should run had finished.
* [reporter.onExit()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-exit) is called immediately before the test runner exits.

Additionally, [reporter.onStdOut()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-std-out) and [reporter.onStdErr()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-std-err) are called when standard output is produced in the worker process, possibly during a test execution, and [reporter.onError()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-error) is called when something went wrong outside of the test execution.

If your custom reporter does not print anything to the terminal, implement [reporter.printsToStdio()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-prints-to-stdio) and return `false`. This way, Playwright will use one of the standard terminal reporters in addition to your custom reporter to enhance user experience.

**Reporter errors**

Playwright will swallow any errors thrown in your custom reporter methods. If you need to detect or fail on reporter errors, you must wrap and handle them yourself.

**Merged report API notes**

When merging multiple [`blob`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters.html#blob-reporter) reports via [`merge-reports`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding.html#merge-reports-cli) CLI command, the same [Reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html "Reporter") API is called to produce final reports and all existing reporters should work without any changes. There some subtle differences though which might affect some custom reporters.

* Projects from different shards are always kept as separate [TestProject](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject.html "TestProject") objects. E.g. if project 'Desktop Chrome' was sharded across 5 machines then there will be 5 instances of projects with the same name in the config passed to [reporter.onBegin()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-begin).

## Methods[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### onBegin[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-begin "Direct link to onBegin")

Added in: v1.10
reporter.onBegin

Called once before running tests. All tests have been already discovered and put into a hierarchy of [Suite](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-suite.html "Suite")s.

**Usage**

```
reporter.onBegin(config, suite);
```

**Arguments**

* `config` [FullConfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-fullconfig.html "FullConfig")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-begin-option-config)

  Resolved configuration.
* `suite` [Suite](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-suite.html "Suite")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-begin-option-suite)

  The root suite that contains all projects, files and test cases.

---

### onEnd[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-end "Direct link to onEnd")

Added in: v1.10
reporter.onEnd

Called after all tests have been run, or testing has been interrupted. Note that this method may return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise") and Playwright Test will await it. Reporter is allowed to override the status and hence affect the exit code of the test runner.

**Usage**

```
await reporter.onEnd(result);
```

**Arguments**

* `result` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-end-option-result)

  + `status` "passed" | "failed" | "timedout" | "interrupted"

    Test run status.
  + `startTime` [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date "Date")

    Test run start wall time.
  + `duration` [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type "Number")

    Test run duration in milliseconds.

  Result of the full test run, `status` can be one of:

  + `'passed'` - Everything went as expected.
  + `'failed'` - Any test has failed.
  + `'timedout'` - The [testConfig.globalTimeout](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-global-timeout) has been reached.
  + `'interrupted'` - Interrupted by the user.

**Returns**

* [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise")<[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")>[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-end-return)
  + `status` "passed" | "failed" | "timedout" | "interrupted" *(optional)*

**Usage**

```
reporter.onError(error);
```

---

### onExit[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-exit "Direct link to onExit")

Added in: v1.33
reporter.onExit

Called immediately before test runner exists. At this point all the reporters have received the [reporter.onEnd()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-reporter.html#reporter-on-end) signal, so all the reports should be build. You can run the code that uploads the reports in this hook.

**Usage**

```
await reporter.onExit();
