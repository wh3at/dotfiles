* * API reference* Classes* Request

On this page

Whenever the page sends a request for a network resource the following sequence of events are emitted by [Page](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html "Page"):

* [page.on('request')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-event-request) emitted when the request is issued by the page.
* [page.on('response')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-event-response) emitted when/if the response status and headers are received for the request.
* [page.on('requestfinished')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-event-request-finished) emitted when the response body is downloaded and the request is complete.

If request fails at some point, then instead of `'requestfinished'` event (and possibly instead of 'response' event), the [page.on('requestfailed')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-event-request-failed) event is emitted.

note

HTTP Error responses, such as 404 or 503, are still successful responses from HTTP standpoint, so request will complete with `'requestfinished'` event.

If request gets a 'redirect' response, the request is successfully finished with the `requestfinished` event, and a new request is issued to a redirected url.

**Usage**

```
await request.allHeaders();
```

**Returns**

* [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise")<[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")<[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string"), [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")>>[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-all-headers-return)

---

### failure[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-failure "Direct link to failure")

Added before v1.9
request.failure

The method returns `null` unless this request has failed, as reported by `requestfailed` event.

**Usage**

Example of logging of all the failed requests:

```
page.on('requestfailed', request => {
  console.log(request.url() + ' ' + request.failure().errorText);
});
```

**Returns**

* [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null "null") | [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-failure-return)
  + `errorText` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

    Human-readable error message, e.g. `'net::ERR_FAILED'`.

---

### frame[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-frame "Direct link to frame")

Added before v1.9
request.frame

Returns the [Frame](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-frame.html "Frame") that initiated this request.

**Usage**

```
const frameUrl = request.frame().url();
```

**Returns**

* [Frame](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-frame.html "Frame")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-frame-return)

**Details**

Note that in some cases the frame is not available, and this method will throw.

* When request originates in the Service Worker. You can use `request.serviceWorker()` to check that.
* When navigation request is issued before the corresponding frame is created. You can use [request.isNavigationRequest()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-is-navigation-request) to check that.

Here is an example that handles all the cases:

```
if (request.serviceWorker())
  console.log(`request ${request.url()} from a service worker`);
else if (request.isNavigationRequest())
  console.log(`request ${request.url()} is a navigation request`);
else
  console.log(`request ${request.url()} from a frame ${request.frame().url()}`);
```

Some navigation requests are issued before the corresponding frame is created, and therefore do not have [request.frame()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-frame) available.

**Usage**

```
request.isNavigationRequest();
```

**Returns**

* [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type "Boolean")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-is-navigation-request-return)

### postDataJSON[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-post-data-json "Direct link to postDataJSON")

Added before v1.9
request.postDataJSON

Returns parsed request's body for `form-urlencoded` and JSON as a fallback if any.

request.postDataJSON();
```

**Returns**

* [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null "null") | [Serializable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Description "Serializable")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-post-data-json-return)

---

### redirectedFrom[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-redirected-from "Direct link to redirectedFrom")

Added before v1.9
request.redirectedFrom

Request that was redirected by the server to this one, if any.

When the server responds with a redirect, Playwright creates a new [Request](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html "Request") object. The two requests are connected by `redirectedFrom()` and `redirectedTo()` methods. When multiple server redirects has happened, it is possible to construct the whole redirect chain by repeatedly calling `redirectedFrom()`.

**Usage**

For example, if the website `http://example.com` redirects to `https://example.com`:

```
const response = await page.goto('http://example.com');
console.log(response.request().redirectedFrom().url()); // 'http://example.com'
```

If the website `https://google.com` has no redirects:

```
const response = await page.goto('https://google.com');
console.log(response.request().redirectedFrom()); // null
```

**Returns**

* [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null "null") | [Request](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html "Request")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-redirected-from-return)

Added before v1.9
request.redirectedTo

New request issued by the browser if the server responded with redirect.

**Usage**

This method is the opposite of [request.redirectedFrom()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-redirected-from):

```
console.log(request.redirectedFrom().redirectedTo() === request); // true
```

**Returns**

* [null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null "null") | [Request](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html "Request")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-redirected-to-return)

---

### resourceType[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-request.html#request-resource-type "Direct link to resourceType")

**Usage**

```
request.resourceType();
```

**Returns**
