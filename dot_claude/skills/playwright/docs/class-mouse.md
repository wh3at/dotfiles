* * API reference* Classes* Mouse

On this page

The Mouse class operates in main-frame CSS pixels relative to the top-left corner of the viewport.

tip

If you want to debug where the mouse moved, you can use the [Trace viewer](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro.html) or [Playwright Inspector](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests.html). A red dot showing the location of the mouse will be shown for every mouse action.

Every `page` object has its own Mouse, accessible with [page.mouse](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-mouse).

```
// Using ‘page.mouse’ to trace a 100x100 square.
await page.mouse.move(0, 0);
await page.mouse.down();
await page.mouse.move(0, 100);
await page.mouse.move(100, 100);
await page.mouse.move(100, 0);
await page.mouse.move(0, 0);
await page.mouse.up();
```
