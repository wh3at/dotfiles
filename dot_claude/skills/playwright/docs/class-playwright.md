* * API reference* Playwright Library

On this page

Playwright module provides a method to launch a browser instance. The following is a typical example of using Playwright to drive automation:

```
const { chromium, firefox, webkit } = require('playwright');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();  // Or 'firefox' or 'webkit'.
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('http://example.com');
  // other actions...
  await browser.close();
})();
```

### errors[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright.html#playwright-errors "Direct link to errors")

Added before v1.9
playwright.errors

Playwright methods might throw errors if they are unable to fulfill a request. For example, [locator.waitFor()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html#locator-wait-for) might fail if the selector doesn't match any nodes during the given timeframe.

For certain types of errors Playwright uses specific error classes. These classes are available via [`playwright.errors`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright.html#playwright-errors).

An example of handling a timeout error:

```
try {
  await page.locator('.foo').waitFor();
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof playwright.errors.TimeoutError) {
    // Do something if this is a timeout.
  }
}
```

**Usage**

```
playwright.errors
```

**Type**

* [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")
  + `TimeoutError` [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function "Function")

    A class of [TimeoutError](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-timeouterror.html "TimeoutError").
