* * Guides* Dialogs

On this page

## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs.html#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Playwright can interact with the web page dialogs such as [`alert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert), [`confirm`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm), [`prompt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) as well as [`beforeunload`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event) confirmation. For print dialogs, see [Print](https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs.html#print-dialogs).

## alert(), confirm(), prompt() dialogs[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs.html#alert-confirm-prompt-dialogs "Direct link to alert(), confirm(), prompt() dialogs")

By default, dialogs are auto-dismissed by Playwright, so you don't have to handle them. However, you can register a dialog handler before the action that triggers the dialog to either [dialog.accept()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-dialog.html#dialog-accept) or [dialog.dismiss()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-dialog.html#dialog-dismiss) it.

```
page.on('dialog', dialog => dialog.accept());
await page.getByRole('button').click();
```

note

[page.on('dialog')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-event-dialog) listener **must handle** the dialog. Otherwise your action will stall, be it [locator.click()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html#locator-click) or something else. That's because dialogs in Web are modals and therefore block further page execution until they are handled.

As a result, the following snippet will never resolve:

warning

WRONG!

```
page.on('dialog', dialog => console.log(dialog.message()));
await page.getByRole('button').click(); // Will hang here
```

note

If there is no listener for [page.on('dialog')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-event-dialog), all dialogs are automatically dismissed.

## beforeunload dialog[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs.html#beforeunload-dialog "Direct link to beforeunload dialog")

When [page.close()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-close) is invoked with the truthy [runBeforeUnload](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-close-option-run-before-unload) value, the page runs its unload handlers. This is the only case when [page.close()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-close) does not wait for the page to actually close, because it might be that the page stays open in the end of the operation.

You can register a dialog handler to handle the `beforeunload` dialog yourself:

```
page.on('dialog', async dialog => {
  assert(dialog.type() === 'beforeunload');
  await dialog.dismiss();
});
await page.close({ runBeforeUnload: true });
```

## Print dialogs[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/dialogs.html#print-dialogs "Direct link to Print dialogs")

In order to assert that a print dialog via [`window.print`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/print) was triggered, you can use the following snippet:

```
await page.goto('<url>');

await page.evaluate('(() => {window.waitForPrintDialog = new Promise(f => window.print = f);})()');
await page.getByText('Print it!').click();

await page.waitForFunction('window.waitForPrintDialog');
```

This will wait for the print dialog to be opened after the button is clicked. Make sure to evaluate the script before clicking the button / after the page is loaded.
