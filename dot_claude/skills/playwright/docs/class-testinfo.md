* * API reference* Test Runner* TestInfo

On this page

`TestInfo` contains information about currently running test. It is available to test functions, [test.beforeEach()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-before-each), [test.afterEach()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-after-each), [test.beforeAll()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-before-all) and [test.afterAll()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-after-all) hooks, and test-scoped fixtures. `TestInfo` provides utilities to control test execution: attach files, update test timeout, determine which test is currently running and whether it was retried, etc.

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  expect(testInfo.title).toBe('basic test');
  await page.screenshot(testInfo.outputPath('screenshot.png'));
});
```

## Methods[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### attach[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-attach "Direct link to attach")

Added in: v1.10
testInfo.attach

Attach a value or a file from disk to the current test. Some reporters show test attachments. Either [path](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-attach-option-path) or [body](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-attach-option-body) must be specified, but not both.

For example, you can attach a screenshot to the test:

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
  const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
  await testInfo.attach('screenshot', { body: screenshot, contentType: 'image/png' });
});
```

Or you can attach files returned by your APIs:

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { download } from './my-custom-helpers';

test('basic test', async ({}, testInfo) => {
  const tmpPath = await download('a');
  await testInfo.attach('downloaded', { path: tmpPath });
});
```

note

[testInfo.attach()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-attach) automatically takes care of copying attached files to a location that is accessible to reporters. You can safely remove the attachment after awaiting the attach call.

**Usage**

```
await testInfo.attach(name);
await testInfo.attach(name, options);
```

**Arguments**

* `name` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-attach-option-name)

### outputPath[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-output-path "Direct link to outputPath")

Added in: v1.10
testInfo.outputPath

Returns a path inside the [testInfo.outputDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-output-dir) where the test can safely put a temporary file. Guarantees that tests running in parallel will not interfere with each other.

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import fs from 'fs';

test('example test', async ({}, testInfo) => {
  const file = testInfo.outputPath('dir', 'temporary-file.txt');

testInfo.retry

Specifies the retry number when the test is retried after a failure. The first test run has [testInfo.retry](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-retry) equal to zero, the first retry has it equal to one, and so on. Learn more about [retries](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-retries.html#retries).

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({}, testInfo) => {
  // You can access testInfo.retry in any hook or fixture.
  if (testInfo.retry > 0)
    console.log(`Retrying!`);
});

test('my test', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  // Here we clear some server-side state when retrying.
  if (testInfo.retry)
    await cleanSomeCachesOnTheServer();
  // ...
});
```

**Usage**

```
testInfo.retry
```

### snapshotDir[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-snapshot-dir "Direct link to snapshotDir")

Added in: v1.10
testInfo.snapshotDir

Absolute path to the snapshot output directory for this specific test. Each test suite gets its own directory so they cannot conflict.

This property does not account for the [testProject.snapshotPathTemplate](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject.html#test-project-snapshot-path-template) configuration.

**Usage**

```
testInfo.snapshotDir
```

**Type**

* [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

---

### snapshotSuffix[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-snapshot-suffix "Direct link to snapshotSuffix")

Added in: v1.10
testInfo.snapshotSuffix

note

Use of [testInfo.snapshotSuffix](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-snapshot-suffix) is discouraged. Please use [testConfig.snapshotPathTemplate](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-snapshot-path-template) to configure snapshot paths.

Suffix used to differentiate snapshots between multiple test configurations. For example, if snapshots depend on the platform, you can set `testInfo.snapshotSuffix` equal to `process.platform`. In this case `expect(value).toMatchSnapshot(snapshotName)` will use different snapshots depending on the platform. Learn more about [snapshots](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots.html).

**Usage**

```
testInfo.snapshotSuffix
```

**Type**

* [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

### status[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-status "Direct link to status")

Added in: v1.10
testInfo.status

Actual status for the currently running test. Available after the test has finished in [test.afterEach()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-after-each) hook and fixtures.

Status is usually compared with the [testInfo.expectedStatus](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-expected-status):

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.afterEach(async ({}, testInfo) => {
  if (testInfo.status !== testInfo.expectedStatus)
    console.log(`${testInfo.title} did not run as expected!`);
});
```

**Usage**

```
testInfo.status
```

**Type**

* "passed" | "failed" | "timedOut" | "skipped" | "interrupted"

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  // Extend timeout for all tests running this hook by 30 seconds.
  testInfo.setTimeout(testInfo.timeout + 30000);
