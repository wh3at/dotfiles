## Setting up GitHub Actions[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#setting-up-github-actions "Direct link to Setting up GitHub Actions")

When [installing Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html) using the [VS Code extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode.html) or with `npm init playwright@latest`, you are given the option to add a [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) workflow. This creates a `playwright.yml` file inside a `.github/workflows` folder containing everything you need so that your tests run on each push and pull request into the main/master branch. Here's how that file looks:

.github/workflows/playwright.yml

```
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v5
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v5
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30
```

The workflow performs these steps:

1. Clone your repository
2. Install Node.js
3. Install NPM Dependencies
4. Install Playwright Browsers
5. Run Playwright tests
6. Upload HTML report to the GitHub UI

To learn more about this, see ["Understanding GitHub Actions"](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

## Create a Repo and Push to GitHub[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#create-a-repo-and-push-to-github "Direct link to Create a Repo and Push to GitHub")

Once you have your [GitHub Actions workflow](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#setting-up-github-actions) setup, then all you need to do is [Create a repo on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) or push your code to an existing repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to [initialize a git repository](https://github.com/git-guides/git-init) using the `git init` command so you can [add](https://github.com/git-guides/git-add), [commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit), and [push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push) your code.

## Opening the Workflows[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#opening-the-workflows "Direct link to Opening the Workflows")

Click on the **Actions** tab to see the workflows. Here you see if your tests have passed or failed.

![opening the workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423783-58bf2008-514e-4f96-9c12-c9a55703960c.png)

## Viewing Test Logs[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#viewing-test-logs "Direct link to Viewing Test Logs")

Clicking on the workflow run shows you all the actions that GitHub performed and clicking on **Run Playwright tests** shows the error messages, what was expected and what was received as well as the call log.

![Viewing Test Logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423783-58bf2008-514e-4f96-9c12-c9a55703960c.png)

## HTML Report[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#html-report "Direct link to HTML Report")

The HTML Report shows you a full report of your tests. You can filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests, and flaky tests.

### Downloading the HTML Report[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#downloading-the-html-report "Direct link to Downloading the HTML Report")

In the Artifacts section, click on the **playwright-report** to download your report in the format of a zip file.

![Downloading the HTML Report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183437023-524f1803-84e4-4862-9ce3-1d55af0e023e.png)

### Viewing the HTML Report[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#viewing-the-html-report "Direct link to Viewing the HTML Report")

Locally opening the report does not work as expected as you need a web server for everything to work correctly. First, extract the zip, preferably in a folder that already has Playwright installed. Using the command line, change into the directory where the report is and use `npx playwright show-report` followed by the name of the extracted folder. This serves up the report and enables you to view it in your browser.

```
npx playwright show-report name-of-my-extracted-playwright-report
```

To learn more about reports, check out our detailed guide on [HTML Reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters.html#html-reporter)

## Viewing the Trace[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#viewing-the-trace "Direct link to Viewing the Trace")

Once you have served the report using `npx playwright show-report`, click on the trace icon next to the test's file name as seen in the image above. You can then view the trace of your tests and inspect each action to try to find out why the tests are failing.

## Publishing report on the web[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#publishing-report-on-the-web "Direct link to Publishing report on the web")

Downloading the HTML report as a zip file is not very convenient. However, we can utilize Azure Storage's static websites hosting capabilities to easily and efficiently serve HTML reports on the Internet, requiring minimal configuration.

1. Create an [Azure Storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create).
2. Enable [Static website hosting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to#enable-static-website-hosting) for the storage account.
3. Create a Service Principal in Azure and grant it access to Azure Blob storage. Upon successful execution, the command will display the credentials which will be used in the next step.

   ```
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions" --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --scopes /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>
   ```
4. Use the credentials from the previous step to set up encrypted secrets in your GitHub repository. Go to your repository's settings, under [GitHub Actions secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository), and add the following secrets:

   * `AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID`
   * `AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET`
   * `AZCOPY_TENANT_ID`

   For a detailed guide on how to authorize a service principal using a client secret, refer to [this Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-authorize-azure-active-directory#authorize-a-service-principal-by-using-a-client-secret).
5. Add a step that uploads the HTML report to Azure Storage.

   .github/workflows/playwright.yml

   ```
   ...
       - name: Upload HTML report to Azure
         shell: bash
         run: |
           REPORT_DIR='run-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}'
           azcopy cp --recursive "./playwright-report/*" "https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.blob.core.windows.net/\$web/$REPORT_DIR"
           echo "::notice title=HTML report url::https://<STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME>.z1.web.core.windows.net/$REPORT_DIR/index.html"
         env:
           AZCOPY_AUTO_LOGIN_TYPE: SPN
           AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID }}'
           AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET }}'
           AZCOPY_TENANT_ID: '${{ secrets.AZCOPY_TENANT_ID }}'
   ```

The contents of the `$web` storage container can be accessed from a browser by using the [public URL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-how-to?tabs=azure-portal#portal-find-url) of the website.

note

This step will not work for pull requests created from a forked repository because such workflow [doesn't have access to the secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#using-secrets-in-a-workflow).

## Properly handling Secrets[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci-intro.html#properly-handling-secrets "Direct link to Properly handling Secrets")

Artifacts like trace files, HTML reports or even the console logs contain information about your test execution. They can contain sensitive data like user credentials for a test user, access tokens to a staging backend, testing source code, or sometimes even your application source code. Treat these files just as carefully as you treat that sensitive data. If you upload reports and traces as part of your CI workflow, make sure that you only upload them to trusted artifact stores, or that you encrypt the files before upload. The same is true for sharing artifacts with team members: Use a trusted file share or encrypt the files before sharing.
