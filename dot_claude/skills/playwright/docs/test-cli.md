```
# This is a test list file.
# It can include comments and empty lines.

# Fully qualified test with a project:
[chromium] › path/to/example.spec.ts:3:9 › suite › nested suite › example test

# This test is included for all projects:
path/to/example.spec.ts:3:9 › example test

# Use "›" or ">" as a separator:
[firefox] > example.spec.ts > suite > nested suite > example test

# Line/column numbers are completely ignored, you can omit them.
# Three entries below refer to the same test:
example.spec.ts › example test
example.spec.ts:15 › example test
example.spec.ts:42:42 › example test
