* * API reference* Classes* Download

On this page

[Download](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-download.html "Download") objects are dispatched by page via the [page.on('download')](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-event-download) event.

All the downloaded files belonging to the browser context are deleted when the browser context is closed.

Download event is emitted once the download starts. Download path becomes available once download completes.

```
// Start waiting for download before clicking. Note no await.
const downloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
await page.getByText('Download file').click();
const download = await downloadPromise;

// Wait for the download process to complete and save the downloaded file somewhere.
await download.saveAs('/path/to/save/at/' + download.suggestedFilename());
```
