* * Migration* Migrating from Puppeteer

On this page

## Migration Principles[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/puppeteer.html#migration-principles "Direct link to Migration Principles")

This guide describes migration to [Playwright Library](https://playwright.dev/docs/library.html) and [Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html) from Puppeteer. The APIs have similarities, but Playwright offers much more possibilities for web testing and cross-browser automation.

* Most Puppeteer APIs can be used as is
* The use of [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-elementhandle.html "ElementHandle") is discouraged, use [Locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html "Locator") objects and web-first assertions instead.
* Playwright is cross-browser
* You probably don't need explicit wait

`page.waitForNavigation` and `page.waitForSelector` remain, but in many cases will not be necessary due to [auto-waiting](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability.html).

The use of [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-elementhandle.html "ElementHandle") is discouraged, use [Locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html "Locator") objects and web-first assertions instead.

Locators are the central piece of Playwright's auto-waiting and retry-ability. Locators are strict. This means that all operations on locators that imply some target DOM element will throw an exception if more than one element matches a given selector.

## Examples[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/puppeteer.html#examples "Direct link to Examples")

### Automation example[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/puppeteer.html#automation-example "Direct link to Automation example")

Puppeteer:

```
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.setViewport({ width: 1280, height: 800 });
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/', {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle2',
  });
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
  await browser.close();
})();
```

Line-by-line migration to Playwright:

```
const { chromium } = require('playwright'); // 1

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage(); // 2
  await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1280, height: 800 }); // 3
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/', {
    waitUntil: 'networkidle', // 4
  });
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
  await browser.close();
})();
```

Migration highlights (see inline comments in the Playwright code snippet):

1. Each Playwright Library file has explicit import of `chromium`. Other browsers `webkit` or `firefox` can be used.
2. For browser state isolation, consider [browser contexts](https://playwright.dev/docs/browser-contexts.html)
3. `setViewport` becomes `setViewportSize`
4. `networkidle2` becomes `networkidle`. Please note that in most cases it is not useful, thanks to auto-waiting.

### Test example[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/puppeteer.html#test-example "Direct link to Test example")

Puppeteer with Jest:

```
import puppeteer from 'puppeteer';

describe('Playwright homepage', () => {
  let browser;
  let page;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    browser = await puppeteer.launch();
    page = await browser.newPage();
  });

  it('contains hero title', async () => {
    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
    await page.waitForSelector('.hero__title');
    const text = await page.$eval('.hero__title', e => e.textContent);
    expect(text).toContain('Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing'); // 5
  });

  afterAll(() => browser.close());
});
```

Line-by-line migration to Playwright Test:

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'; // 1

test.describe('Playwright homepage', () => {
  test('contains hero title', async ({ page }) => { // 2, 3
    await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
    const titleLocator = page.locator('.hero__title'); // 4
    await expect(titleLocator).toContainText( // 5
        'Playwright enables reliable end-to-end testing'
    );
  });
});
```

1. Each Playwright Test file has explicit import of the `test` and `expect` functions
2. Test function is marked with `async`
3. Playwright Test is given a `page` as one of its parameters. This is one of the many [useful fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-fixtures.html) in Playwright Test. Playwright Test creates an isolated [Page](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html "Page") object for each test. However, if you'd like to reuse a single [Page](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html "Page") object between multiple tests, you can create your own in [test.beforeAll()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-before-all) and close it in [test.afterAll()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-after-all).
4. Locator creation with [page.locator()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-locator) is one of the few methods that is sync.
5. Use [assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions.html) to verify the state instead of `page.$eval()`.

## Testing[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/puppeteer.html#testing "Direct link to Testing")

To improve testing, it is advised to use [Locators](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html) and web-first [Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions.html). See [Writing Tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests.html)

It is common with Puppeteer to use `page.evaluate()` or `page.$eval()` to inspect an [ElementHandle](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-elementhandle.html "ElementHandle") and extract the value of text content, attribute, class... Web-first [Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions.html) offers several matchers for this purpose, it is more reliable and readable.

[Playwright Test](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html) is our first-party recommended test runner to be used with Playwright. It provides several features like Page Object Model, parallelism, fixtures or reporters.
