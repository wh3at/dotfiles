On this page

## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver.html#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Playwright comes with a `webServer` option in the config file which gives you the ability to launch a local dev server before running your tests. This is ideal for when writing your tests during development and when you don't have a staging or production url to test against.

## Configuring a web server[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver.html#configuring-a-web-server "Direct link to Configuring a web server")

Use the `webServer` property in your Playwright config to launch a development web server during the tests.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Run your local dev server before starting the tests
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    stdout: 'ignore',
    stderr: 'pipe',
  },
});
```

Defaults to inheriting `process.env` with `PLAYWRIGHT_TEST=1` added.| `gracefulShutdown` How to shut down the process. If unspecified, the process group is forcefully `SIGKILL`ed. If set to `{ signal: 'SIGTERM', timeout: 500 }`, the process group is sent a `SIGTERM` signal, followed by `SIGKILL` if it doesn't exit within 500ms. You can also use `SIGINT` as the signal instead. A `0` timeout means no `SIGKILL` will be sent. Windows doesn't support `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals, so this option is ignored on Windows. Note that shutting down a Docker container requires `SIGTERM`.| `ignoreHTTPSErrors` Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when fetching the `url`. Defaults to `false`.| `name` Specifies a custom name for the web server. This name will be prefixed to log messages. Defaults to `[WebServer]`.| `port` **Deprecated**. User `url` instead. The port that your http server is expected to appear on. It does wait until it accepts connections. Either `port` or `url` should be specified.| `reuseExistingServer` If `true`, it will re-use an existing server on the `port` or `url` when available. If no server is running on that `port` or `url`, it will run the command to start a new server. If `false`, it will throw if an existing process is listening on the `port` or `url`. This should be commonly set to `!process.env.CI` to allow the local dev server when running tests locally.| `stderr` Whether to pipe the stderr of the command to the process stderr or ignore it. Defaults to `"pipe"`.| `stdout` If `"pipe"`, it will pipe the stdout of the command to the process stdout. If `"ignore"`, it will ignore the stdout of the command. Default to `"ignore"`.| `timeout` How long to wait for the process to start up and be available in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000.|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `url` URL of your http server that is expected to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or 403 status code when the server is ready to accept connections. Either `port` or `url` should be specified.| `wait` Consider command started only when given output has been produced. Takes an object with optional `stdout` and/or `stderr` regular expressions. Named capture groups in the regex are stored in the environment, for example `/Listening on port (?<my_server_port>\\d+)/` will store the port number in `process.env['MY_SERVER_PORT']`. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

## Adding a server timeout[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver.html#adding-a-server-timeout "Direct link to Adding a server timeout")

Webservers can sometimes take longer to boot up. In this case, you can increase the timeout to wait for the server to start.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Rest of your config...

  // Run your local dev server before starting the tests
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 120 * 1000,
  },
});
```

## Adding a baseURL[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver.html#adding-a-baseurl "Direct link to Adding a baseURL")

It is also recommended to specify the `baseURL` in the `use: {}` section of your config, so that tests can use relative urls and you don't have to specify the full URL over and over again.

When using [page.goto()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-goto), [page.route()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-route), [page.waitForURL()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-wait-for-url), [page.waitForRequest()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-wait-for-request), or [page.waitForResponse()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-wait-for-response) it takes the base URL in consideration by using the [`URL()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) constructor for building the corresponding URL. For Example, by setting the baseURL to `http://localhost:3000` and navigating to `/login` in your tests, Playwright will run the test using `http://localhost:3000/login`.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Rest of your config...

  // Run your local dev server before starting the tests
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  },
});
```

Now you can use a relative path when navigating the page:

test.spec.ts

```
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  // This will navigate to http://localhost:3000/login
  await page.goto('./login');
});
```

## Multiple web servers[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver.html#multiple-web-servers "Direct link to Multiple web servers")

Multiple web servers (or background processes) can be launched simultaneously by providing an array of `webServer` configurations. See [testConfig.webServer](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-web-server) for more info.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  webServer: [
    {
      command: 'npm run start',
      url: 'http://localhost:3000',
      name: 'Frontend',
      timeout: 120 * 1000,
      reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    },
    {
      command: 'npm run backend',
      url: 'http://localhost:3333',
      name: 'Backend',
      timeout: 120 * 1000,
      reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    }
  ],
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  },
});
```
