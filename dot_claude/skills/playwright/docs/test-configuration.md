* * Playwright Test* Configuration

On this page

## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Playwright has many options to configure how your tests are run. You can specify these options in the configuration file. Note that test runner options are **top-level**, do not put them into the `use` section.

## Basic Configuration[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html#basic-configuration "Direct link to Basic Configuration")

Here are some of the most common configuration options.

```
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Look for test files in the "tests" directory, relative to this configuration file.
  testDir: 'tests',

  // Run all tests in parallel.
  fullyParallel: true,

  // Fail the build on CI if you accidentally left test.only in the source code.
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,

  // Retry on CI only.
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,

  // Opt out of parallel tests on CI.
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,

  // Reporter to use
  reporter: 'html',

  use: {
    // Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`.
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',

    // Collect trace when retrying the failed test.
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  // Configure projects for major browsers.
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
  ],
  // Run your local dev server before starting the tests.
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

## Filtering Tests[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html#filtering-tests "Direct link to Filtering Tests")

Filter tests by glob patterns or regular expressions.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Glob patterns or regular expressions to ignore test files.
  testIgnore: '*test-assets',

  // Glob patterns or regular expressions that match test files.
  testMatch: '*todo-tests/*.spec.ts',
});
```

|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Option Description|  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | [testConfig.testIgnore](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-test-ignore) Glob patterns or regular expressions that should be ignored when looking for the test files. For example, `'*test-assets'`| [testConfig.testMatch](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-test-match) Glob patterns or regular expressions that match test files. For example, `'*todo-tests/*.spec.ts'`. By default, Playwright runs `.*(test|spec).(js|ts|mjs)` files. | | | | | |

## Advanced Configuration[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html#advanced-configuration "Direct link to Advanced Configuration")

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Folder for test artifacts such as screenshots, videos, traces, etc.
  outputDir: 'test-results',

  // path to the global setup files.
  globalSetup: require.resolve('./global-setup'),

  // path to the global teardown files.
  globalTeardown: require.resolve('./global-teardown'),

  // Each test is given 30 seconds.
  timeout: 30000,

});
```

Time spent by the test function, test fixtures and beforeEach hooks is included in the test timeout. | | | | | | | | | |

## Expect Options[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html#expect-options "Direct link to Expect Options")

Configuration for the expect assertion library.

    timeout: 5000,

    toHaveScreenshot: {
      // An acceptable amount of pixels that could be different, unset by default.
      maxDiffPixels: 10,
    },

    toMatchSnapshot: {
      // An acceptable ratio of pixels that are different to the
      // total amount of pixels, between 0 and 1.
      maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.1,
    },

This is the maximum time the `expect()` should wait for the condition to be met. Learn more about [test and expect timeouts](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts.html) and how to set them for a single test.| [expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-pageassertions.html#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-1) Configuration for the `expect(locator).toHaveScreenshot()` method.| [expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-snapshotassertions.html#snapshot-assertions-to-match-snapshot-1) Configuration for the `expect(locator).toMatchSnapshot()` method. | | | | | | | |
