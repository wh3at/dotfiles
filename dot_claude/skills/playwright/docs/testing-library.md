* * Migration* Migrating from Testing Library

On this page

## Migration principles[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/testing-library.html#migration-principles "Direct link to Migration principles")

This guide describes migration to Playwright's [Experimental Component Testing](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-components.html) from [DOM Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/intro/), [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), [Vue Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/vue-testing-library/intro) and [Svelte Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/svelte-testing-library/intro).

note

If you use DOM Testing Library in the browser (for example, you bundle end-to-end tests with webpack), you can switch directly to Playwright Test. Examples below are focused on component tests, but for end-to-end test you just need to replace `await mount` with `await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')` to open the page under test.

## Example[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/testing-library.html#example "Direct link to Example")

Testing Library:

```
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';

test('sign in', async () => {
  // Setup the page.
  const user = userEvent.setup();
  render(<SignInPage />);

  // Perform actions.
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Username'), 'John');
  await user.type(screen.getByLabelText('Password'), 'secret');
  await user.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }));

  // Verify signed in state by waiting until "Welcome" message appears.
  expect(await screen.findByText('Welcome, John')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Line-by-line migration to Playwright Test:

```
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/experimental-ct-react'); // 1

test('sign in', async ({ mount }) => { // 2
  // Setup the page.
  const component = await mount(<SignInPage />); // 3

  // Perform actions.
  await component.getByLabel('Username').fill('John'); // 4
  await component.getByLabel('Password').fill('secret');
  await component.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();

  // Verify signed in state by waiting until "Welcome" message appears.
  await expect(component.getByText('Welcome, John')).toBeVisible(); // 5
});
```

Migration highlights (see inline comments in the Playwright Test code snippet):

1. Import everything from `@playwright/experimental-ct-react` (or -vue, -svelte) for component tests, or from `@playwright/test` for end-to-end tests.
2. Test function is given a `page` that is isolated from other tests, and `mount` that renders a component in this page. These are two of the [useful fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-fixtures.html) in Playwright Test.
3. Replace `render` with `mount` that returns a [component locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators.html).
4. Use locators created with [locator.locator()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html#locator-locator) or [page.locator()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-locator) to perform most of the actions.
5. Use [assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions.html) to verify the state.

## Migrating queries[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/testing-library.html#migrating-queries "Direct link to Migrating queries")

All queries like `getBy...`, `findBy...`, `queryBy...` and their multi-element counterparts are replaced with `component.getBy...` locators. Locators always auto-wait and retry when needed, so you don't have to worry about choosing the right method. When you want to do a [list operation](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators.html#lists), e.g. assert a list of texts, Playwright automatically performs multi-element operations.

## Replacing `waitFor`[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/testing-library.html#replacing-waitfor "Direct link to replacing-waitfor")

Playwright includes [assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions.html) that automatically wait for the condition, so you don't usually need an explicit `waitFor`/`waitForElementToBeRemoved` call.

```
// Testing Library
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(getByText('the lion king')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => queryByText('the mummy'));

// Playwright
await expect(page.getByText('the lion king')).toBeVisible();
await expect(page.getByText('the mummy')).toBeHidden();
```

When you cannot find a suitable assertion, use [`expect.poll`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions.html#expectpoll) instead.

```
await expect.poll(async () => {
  const response = await page.request.get('https://api.example.com');
  return response.status();
}).toBe(200);
```

## Replacing `within`[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/testing-library.html#replacing-within "Direct link to replacing-within")

You can create a locator inside another locator with [locator.locator()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html#locator-locator) method.

```
// Testing Library
const messages = screen.getByTestId('messages');
const helloMessage = within(messages).getByText('hello');

// Playwright
const messages = component.getByTestId('messages');
const helloMessage = messages.getByText('hello');
```
