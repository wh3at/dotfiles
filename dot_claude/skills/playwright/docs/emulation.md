* * Playwright Test* Emulation

On this page

## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

With Playwright you can test your app on any browser as well as emulate a real device such as a mobile phone or tablet. Simply configure the devices you would like to emulate and Playwright will simulate the browser behavior such as `"userAgent"`, `"screenSize"`, `"viewport"` and if it `"hasTouch"` enabled. You can also emulate the `"geolocation"`, `"locale"` and `"timezone"` for all tests or for a specific test as well as set the `"permissions"` to show notifications or change the `"colorScheme"`.

## Devices[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#devices "Direct link to Devices")

Playwright comes with a [registry of device parameters](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/playwright-core/src/server/deviceDescriptorsSource.json) using [playwright.devices](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-playwright.html#playwright-devices) for selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices. It can be used to simulate browser behavior for a specific device such as user agent, screen size, viewport and if it has touch enabled. All tests will run with the specified device parameters.

* Test* Library

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'; // import devices

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'Mobile Safari',
      use: {
        ...devices['iPhone 13'],
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

```
const { chromium, devices } = require('playwright');
const browser = await chromium.launch();

const iphone13 = devices['iPhone 13'];
const context = await browser.newContext({
  ...iphone13,
});
```

## Viewport[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#viewport "Direct link to Viewport")

The viewport is included in the device but you can override it for some tests with [page.setViewportSize()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-set-viewport-size).

* Test* Library

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
        // It is important to define the `viewport` property after destructuring `devices`,
        // since devices also define the `viewport` for that device.
        viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
      },
    },
  ]
});
```

```
// Create context with given viewport
const context = await browser.newContext({
  viewport: { width: 1280, height: 1024 }
});
```

Test file:

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
  viewport: { width: 1600, height: 1200 },
});

test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
  // ...
});
```

```
// Create context with given viewport
const context = await browser.newContext({
  viewport: { width: 1280, height: 1024 }
});

// Resize viewport for individual page
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1600, height: 1200 });

// Emulate high-DPI
const context = await browser.newContext({
  viewport: { width: 2560, height: 1440 },
  deviceScaleFactor: 2,
});
```

The same works inside a test file.

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('specific viewport block', () => {
  test.use({ viewport: { width: 1600, height: 1200 } });

  test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

```
// Create context with given viewport
const context = await browser.newContext({
  viewport: { width: 1600, height: 1200 }
});
const page = await context.newPage();
```

## isMobile[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#ismobile "Direct link to isMobile")

Whether the meta viewport tag is taken into account and touch events are enabled.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
        // It is important to define the `isMobile` property after destructuring `devices`,
        // since devices also define the `isMobile` for that device.
        isMobile: false,
      },
    },
  ]
});
```

## Locale & Timezone[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#locale--timezone "Direct link to Locale & Timezone")

Emulate the browser Locale and Timezone which can be set globally for all tests in the config and then overridden for particular tests.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    // Emulates the browser locale.
    locale: 'en-GB',

    // Emulates the browser timezone.
    timezoneId: 'Europe/Paris',
  },
});
```

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
  locale: 'de-DE',
  timezoneId: 'Europe/Berlin',
});

test('my test for de lang in Berlin timezone', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://www.bing.com');
  // ...
});
```

```
const context = await browser.newContext({
  locale: 'de-DE',
  timezoneId: 'Europe/Berlin',
});
```

![Bing in german lang and timezone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/220416571-ccc96ab1-44bb-4579-8430-64502fc24a15.png)

######

Note that this only affects the browser timezone and locale, not the test runner timezone. To set the test runner timezone, you can use the [`TZ` environment variable](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#tz).

## Permissions[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#permissions "Direct link to Permissions")

Allow app to show system notifications.

* Test* Library

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    // Grants specified permissions to the browser context.
    permissions: ['notifications'],
  },
});
```

```
const context = await browser.newContext({
  permissions: ['notifications'],
});
```

Allow notifications for a specific domain.

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test.beforeEach(async ({ context }) => {
  // Runs before each test and signs in each page.
  await context.grantPermissions(['notifications'], { origin: 'https://skype.com' });
});

test('first', async ({ page }) => {
  // page has notifications permission for https://skype.com.
});
```

```
await context.grantPermissions(['notifications'], { origin: 'https://skype.com' });
```

Revoke all permissions with [browserContext.clearPermissions()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext.html#browser-context-clear-permissions).

```
// Library
await context.clearPermissions();
```

## Geolocation[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#geolocation "Direct link to Geolocation")

Grant `"geolocation"` permissions and set geolocation to a specific area.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    // Context geolocation
    geolocation: { longitude: 12.492507, latitude: 41.889938 },
    permissions: ['geolocation'],
  },
});
```

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
  geolocation: { longitude: 41.890221, latitude: 12.492348 },
  permissions: ['geolocation'],
});

test('my test with geolocation', async ({ page }) => {
  // ...
});
```

```
const context = await browser.newContext({
  geolocation: { longitude: 41.890221, latitude: 12.492348 },
  permissions: ['geolocation']
});
```

Change the location later:

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
  geolocation: { longitude: 41.890221, latitude: 12.492348 },
  permissions: ['geolocation'],
});

test('my test with geolocation', async ({ page, context }) => {
  // overwrite the location for this test
  await context.setGeolocation({ longitude: 48.858455, latitude: 2.294474 });
});
```

```
await context.setGeolocation({ longitude: 48.858455, latitude: 2.294474 });
```

**Note** you can only change geolocation for all pages in the context.

## Color Scheme and Media[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#color-scheme-and-media "Direct link to Color Scheme and Media")

Emulate the users `"colorScheme"`. Supported values are 'light' and 'dark'. You can also emulate the media type with [page.emulateMedia()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-emulate-media).

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    colorScheme: 'dark',
  },
});
```

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({
  colorScheme: 'dark' // or 'light'
});

test('my test with dark mode', async ({ page }) => {
  // ...
});
```

```
// Create context with dark mode
const context = await browser.newContext({
  colorScheme: 'dark' // or 'light'
});

// Create page with dark mode
const page = await browser.newPage({
  colorScheme: 'dark' // or 'light'
});

// Change color scheme for the page
await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' });

// Change media for page
await page.emulateMedia({ media: 'print' });
```

## User Agent[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#user-agent "Direct link to User Agent")

The User Agent is included in the device and therefore you will rarely need to change it however if you do need to test a different user agent you can override it with the `userAgent` property.

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ userAgent: 'My user agent' });

test('my user agent test', async ({ page }) => {
  // ...
});
```

```
const context = await browser.newContext({
  userAgent: 'My user agent'
});
```

## Offline[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#offline "Direct link to Offline")

Emulate the network being offline.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    offline: true
  },
});
```

## JavaScript Enabled[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/emulation.html#javascript-enabled "Direct link to JavaScript Enabled")

Emulate a user scenario where JavaScript is disabled.

* Test* Library

tests/example.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ javaScriptEnabled: false });

test('test with no JavaScript', async ({ page }) => {
  // ...
});
```

```
const context = await browser.newContext({
  javaScriptEnabled: false
});
```
