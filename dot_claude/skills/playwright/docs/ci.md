## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Playwright tests can be executed in CI environments. We have created sample configurations for common CI providers.

3 steps to get your tests running on CI:

1. **Ensure CI agent can run browsers**: Use [our Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html) in Linux agents or install your dependencies using the [CLI](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers.html#install-system-dependencies).
2. **Install Playwright**:

   ```
   # Install NPM packages
   npm ci

   # Install Playwright browsers and dependencies
   npx playwright install --with-deps
   ```
3. **Run your tests**:

   ```
   npx playwright test
   ```

## Workers[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#workers "Direct link to Workers")

We recommend setting [workers](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-workers) to "1" in CI environments to prioritize stability and reproducibility. Running tests sequentially ensures each test gets the full system resources, avoiding potential conflicts. However, if you have a powerful self-hosted CI system, you may enable [parallel](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel.html) tests. For wider parallelization, consider [sharding](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel.html#shard-tests-between-multiple-machines) - distributing tests across multiple CI jobs.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Opt out of parallel tests on CI.
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
});
```

## CI configurations[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#ci-configurations "Direct link to CI configurations")

The [Command line tools](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers.html#install-system-dependencies) can be used to install all operating system dependencies in CI.

### GitHub Actions[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#github-actions "Direct link to GitHub Actions")

#### On push/pull\_request[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#on-pushpull_request "Direct link to On push/pull_request")

Tests will run on push or pull request on branches main/master. The [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) will install all dependencies, install Playwright and then run the tests. It will also create the HTML report.

.github/workflows/playwright.yml

```
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v5
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v5
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30
```

#### On push/pull\_request (sharded)[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#on-pushpull_request-sharded "Direct link to On push/pull_request (sharded)")

GitHub Actions supports [sharding tests between multiple jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs). Check out our [sharding doc](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding.html) to learn more about sharding and to see a [GitHub actions example](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-sharding.html#github-actions-example) of how to configure a job to run your tests on multiple machines as well as how to merge the HTML reports.

#### Via Containers[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#via-containers "Direct link to Via Containers")

GitHub Actions support [running jobs in a container](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container) by using the [`jobs.<job_id>.container`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer) option. This is useful to not pollute the host environment with dependencies and to have a consistent environment for e.g. screenshots/visual regression testing across different operating systems.

.github/workflows/playwright.yml

```
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  playwright:
    name: 'Playwright Tests'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
      options: --user 1001
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
        with:
          node-version: lts/*
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run your tests
        run: npx playwright test
```

#### On deployment[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#on-deployment "Direct link to On deployment")

This will start the tests after a [GitHub Deployment](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/) went into the `success` state. Services like Vercel use this pattern so you can run your end-to-end tests on their deployed environment.

.github/workflows/playwright.yml

```
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  deployment_status:
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v5
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
      env:
        PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.target_url }}
```

#### Fail-Fast[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#fail-fast "Direct link to Fail-Fast")

Large test suites can take very long to execute. By executing a preliminary test run with the `--only-changed` flag, you can run test files that are likely to fail first. This will give you a faster feedback loop and slightly lower CI consumption while working on Pull Requests. To detect test files affected by your changeset, `--only-changed` analyses your suites' dependency graph. This is a heuristic and might miss tests, so it's important that you always run the full test suite after the preliminary test run.

.github/workflows/playwright.yml

```
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      with:
        # Force a non-shallow checkout, so that we can reference $GITHUB_BASE_REF.
        # See https://github.com/actions/checkout for more details.
        fetch-depth: 0
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v6
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run changed Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test --only-changed=$GITHUB_BASE_REF
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v5
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30
```

### Docker[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#docker "Direct link to Docker")

We have a [pre-built Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html) which can either be used directly or as a reference to update your existing Docker definitions. Make sure to follow the [Recommended Docker Configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html#recommended-docker-configuration) to ensure the best performance.

### Azure Pipelines[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#azure-pipelines "Direct link to Azure Pipelines")

For Windows or macOS agents, no additional configuration is required, just install Playwright and run your tests.

For Linux agents, you can use [our Docker container](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html) with Azure Pipelines support [running containerized jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/container-phases?view=azure-devops). Alternatively, you can use [Command line tools](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers.html#install-system-dependencies) to install all necessary dependencies.

For running the Playwright tests use this pipeline task:

```
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: UseNode@1
  inputs:
    version: '22'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'
- script: npm ci
  displayName: 'npm ci'
- script: npx playwright install --with-deps
  displayName: 'Install Playwright browsers'
- script: npx playwright test
  displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
  env:
    CI: 'true'
```

#### Uploading playwright-report folder with Azure Pipelines[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#uploading-playwright-report-folder-with-azure-pipelines "Direct link to Uploading playwright-report folder with Azure Pipelines")

This will make the pipeline run fail if any of the playwright tests fails. If you also want to integrate the test results with Azure DevOps, use the task `PublishTestResults` task like so:

```
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: UseNode@1
  inputs:
    version: '22'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: npm ci
  displayName: 'npm ci'
- script: npx playwright install --with-deps
  displayName: 'Install Playwright browsers'
- script: npx playwright test
  displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
  env:
    CI: 'true'
- task: PublishTestResults@2
  displayName: 'Publish test results'
  inputs:
    searchFolder: 'test-results'
    testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
    testResultsFiles: 'e2e-junit-results.xml'
    mergeTestResults: true
    failTaskOnFailedTests: true
    testRunTitle: 'My End-To-End Tests'
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: playwright-report
    artifact: playwright-report
    publishLocation: 'pipeline'
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
```

Note: The JUnit reporter needs to be configured accordingly via

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results/e2e-junit-results.xml' }]],
});
```

in `playwright.config.ts`.

#### Azure Pipelines (sharded)[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#azure-pipelines-sharded "Direct link to Azure Pipelines (sharded)")

```
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

strategy:
  matrix:
    chromium-1:
      project: chromium
      shard: 1/3
    chromium-2:
      project: chromium
      shard: 2/3
    chromium-3:
      project: chromium
      shard: 3/3
    firefox-1:
      project: firefox
      shard: 1/3
    firefox-2:
      project: firefox
      shard: 2/3
    firefox-3:
      project: firefox
      shard: 3/3
    webkit-1:
      project: webkit
      shard: 1/3
    webkit-2:
      project: webkit
      shard: 2/3
    webkit-3:
      project: webkit
      shard: 3/3
steps:
- task: UseNode@1
  inputs:
    version: '22'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: npm ci
  displayName: 'npm ci'
- script: npx playwright install --with-deps
  displayName: 'Install Playwright browsers'
- script: npx playwright test --project=$(project) --shard=$(shard)
  displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
  env:
    CI: 'true'
```

#### Azure Pipelines (containerized)[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#azure-pipelines-containerized "Direct link to Azure Pipelines (containerized)")

```
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest
container: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble

steps:
- task: UseNode@1
  inputs:
    version: '22'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: npm ci
  displayName: 'npm ci'
- script: npx playwright test
  displayName: 'Run Playwright tests'
  env:
    CI: 'true'
```

### CircleCI[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#circleci "Direct link to CircleCI")

Running Playwright on CircleCI is very similar to running on GitHub Actions. In order to specify the pre-built Playwright [Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html), simply modify the agent definition with `docker:` in your config like so:

```
executors:
  pw-noble-development:
    docker:
      - image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
```

Note: When using the docker agent definition, you are specifying the resource class of where playwright runs to the 'medium' tier [here](https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference?#docker-execution-environment). The default behavior of Playwright is to set the number of workers to the detected core count (2 in the case of the medium tier). Overriding the number of workers to greater than this number will cause unnecessary timeouts and failures.

#### Sharding in CircleCI[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#sharding-in-circleci "Direct link to Sharding in CircleCI")

Sharding in CircleCI is indexed with 0 which means that you will need to override the default parallelism ENV VARS. The following example demonstrates how to run Playwright with a CircleCI Parallelism of 4 by adding 1 to the `CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX` to pass into the `--shard` cli arg.

```
  playwright-job-name:
    executor: pw-noble-development
    parallelism: 4
    steps:
      - run: SHARD="$((${CIRCLE_NODE_INDEX}+1))"; npx playwright test --shard=${SHARD}/${CIRCLE_NODE_TOTAL}
```

### Jenkins[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#jenkins "Direct link to Jenkins")

Jenkins supports Docker agents for pipelines. Use the [Playwright Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html) to run tests on Jenkins.

```
pipeline {
   agent { docker { image 'mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble' } }
   stages {
      stage('e2e-tests') {
         steps {
            sh 'npm ci'
            sh 'npx playwright test'
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### Bitbucket Pipelines[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#bitbucket-pipelines "Direct link to Bitbucket Pipelines")

Bitbucket Pipelines can use public [Docker images as build environments](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/use-docker-images-as-build-environments-792298897.html). To run Playwright tests on Bitbucket, use our public Docker image ([see Dockerfile](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html)).

```
image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
```

### GitLab CI[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#gitlab-ci "Direct link to GitLab CI")

To run Playwright tests on GitLab, use our public Docker image ([see Dockerfile](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html)).

```
stages:
  - test

tests:
  stage: test
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
  script:
  ...
```

#### Sharding[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#sharding "Direct link to Sharding")

GitLab CI supports [sharding tests between multiple jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/job_control.html#parallelize-large-jobs) using the [parallel](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#parallel) keyword. The test job will be split into multiple smaller jobs that run in parallel. Parallel jobs are named sequentially from `job_name 1/N` to `job_name N/N`.

```
stages:
  - test

tests:
  stage: test
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
  parallel: 7
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npx playwright test --shard=$CI_NODE_INDEX/$CI_NODE_TOTAL
```

GitLab CI also supports sharding tests between multiple jobs using the [parallel:matrix](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#parallelmatrix) option. The test job will run multiple times in parallel in a single pipeline, but with different variable values for each instance of the job. In the example below, we have 2 `PROJECT` values and 10 `SHARD` values, resulting in a total of 20 jobs to be run.

```
stages:
  - test

tests:
  stage: test
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
  parallel:
    matrix:
      - PROJECT: ['chromium', 'webkit']
        SHARD: ['1/10', '2/10', '3/10', '4/10', '5/10', '6/10', '7/10', '8/10', '9/10', '10/10']
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npx playwright test --project=$PROJECT --shard=$SHARD
```

### Google Cloud Build[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#google-cloud-build "Direct link to Google Cloud Build")

To run Playwright tests on Google Cloud Build, use our public Docker image ([see Dockerfile](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html)).

```
steps:
- name: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
  script:
  ...
  env:
  - 'CI=true'
```

### Drone[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#drone "Direct link to Drone")

To run Playwright tests on Drone, use our public Docker image ([see Dockerfile](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html)).

```
kind: pipeline
name: default
type: docker

steps:
  - name: test
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.57.0-noble
    commands:
      - npx playwright test
```

## Caching browsers[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#caching-browsers "Direct link to Caching browsers")

Caching browser binaries is not recommended, since the amount of time it takes to restore the cache is comparable to the time it takes to download the binaries. Especially under Linux, [operating system dependencies](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers.html#install-system-dependencies) need to be installed, which are not cacheable.

If you still want to cache the browser binaries between CI runs, cache [these directories](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers.html#managing-browser-binaries) in your CI configuration, against a hash of the Playwright version.

## Debugging browser launches[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#debugging-browser-launches "Direct link to Debugging browser launches")

Playwright supports the `DEBUG` environment variable to output debug logs during execution. Setting it to `pw:browser` is helpful while debugging `Error: Failed to launch browser` errors.

```
DEBUG=pw:browser npx playwright test
```

## Running headed[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci.html#running-headed "Direct link to Running headed")

By default, Playwright launches browsers in headless mode. See in our [Running tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests.html#run-tests-in-headed-mode) guide how to run tests in headed mode.

On Linux agents, headed execution requires [Xvfb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvfb) to be installed. Our [Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker.html) and GitHub Action have Xvfb pre-installed. To run browsers in headed mode with Xvfb, add `xvfb-run` before the actual command.

```
xvfb-run npx playwright test
```
