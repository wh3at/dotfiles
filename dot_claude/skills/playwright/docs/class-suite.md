  + Project suite #1. Has a child suite for each test file in the project.
    - File suite #1
      * [TestCase](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testcase.html "TestCase") #1
      * [TestCase](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testcase.html "TestCase") #2
      * Suite corresponding to a [test.describe()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-describe) group
        + [TestCase](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testcase.html "TestCase") #1 in a group
        + [TestCase](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testcase.html "TestCase") #2 in a group
      * < more test cases ... >
    - File suite #2
    - < more file suites ... >
  + Project suite #2
  + < more project suites ... >
