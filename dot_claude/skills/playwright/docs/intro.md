## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Playwright Test is an end-to-end test framework for modern web apps. It bundles test runner, assertions, isolation, parallelization and rich tooling. Playwright supports Chromium, WebKit and Firefox on Windows, Linux and macOS, locally or in CI, headless or headed, with native mobile emulation for Chrome (Android) and Mobile Safari.

## Installing Playwright[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#installing-playwright "Direct link to Installing Playwright")

Get started by installing Playwright using one of the following methods.

### Using npm, yarn or pnpm[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#using-npm-yarn-or-pnpm "Direct link to Using npm, yarn or pnpm")

The command below either initializes a new project or adds Playwright to an existing one.

* npm* yarn* pnpm

```
npm init playwright@latest
```

```
yarn create playwright
```

```
pnpm create playwright
```

When prompted, choose / confirm:

* TypeScript or JavaScript (default: TypeScript)
* Tests folder name (default: `tests`, or `e2e` if `tests` already exists)
* Add a GitHub Actions workflow (recommended for CI)
* Install Playwright browsers (default: yes)

You can re-run the command later; it does not overwrite existing tests.

### Using the VS Code Extension[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#using-the-vs-code-extension "Direct link to Using the VS Code Extension")

You can also create and run tests with the [VS Code Extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode.html).

## What's Installed[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#whats-installed "Direct link to What's Installed")

Playwright downloads required browser binaries and creates the scaffold below.

```
playwright.config.ts         # Test configuration
package.json
package-lock.json            # Or yarn.lock / pnpm-lock.yaml
tests/
  example.spec.ts            # Minimal example test
```

The [playwright.config](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html) centralizes configuration: target browsers, timeouts, retries, projects, reporters and more. In existing projects dependencies are added to your current `package.json`.

`tests/` contains a minimal starter test.

## Running the Example Test[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#running-the-example-test "Direct link to Running the Example Test")

By default tests run headless in parallel across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit (configurable in [playwright.config](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html)). Output and aggregated results display in the terminal.

* npm* yarn* pnpm

```
npx playwright test
```

```
yarn playwright test
```

```
pnpm exec playwright test
```

Tips:

* See the browser window: add `--headed`.
* Run a single project/browser: `--project=chromium`.
* Run one file: `npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts`.
* Open testing UI: `--ui`.

See [Running Tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests.html) for details on filtering, headed mode, sharding and retries.

## HTML Test Reports[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#html-test-reports "Direct link to HTML Test Reports")

After a test run, the [HTML Reporter](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-reporters.html#html-reporter) provides a dashboard filterable by the browser, passed, failed, skipped, flaky and more. Click a test to inspect errors, attachments and steps. It auto-opens only when failures occur; open manually with the command below.

* npm* yarn* pnpm

```
npx playwright show-report
```

```
yarn playwright show-report
```

```
pnpm exec playwright show-report
```

## Running the Example Test in UI Mode[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#running-the-example-test-in-ui-mode "Direct link to Running the Example Test in UI Mode")

Run tests with [UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode.html) for watch mode, live step view, time travel debugging and more.

* npm* yarn* pnpm

```
npx playwright test --ui
```

```
yarn playwright test --ui
```

```
pnpm exec playwright test --ui
```

![UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/assets/images/ui-mode-1958baf0398aef5e9c9b5c68c5d56f2d.png)

See the [detailed guide on UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode.html) for watch filters, step details and trace integration.

## Updating Playwright[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro.html#updating-playwright "Direct link to Updating Playwright")

Update Playwright and download new browser binaries and their dependencies:

* npm* yarn* pnpm

```
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

```
yarn add --dev @playwright/test@latest
yarn playwright install --with-deps
```

```
pnpm install --save-dev @playwright/test@latest
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps

Check your installed version:

* npm* yarn* pnpm

```
npx playwright --version

```
pnpm exec playwright --version
