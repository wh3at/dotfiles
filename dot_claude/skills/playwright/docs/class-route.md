## Methods[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### abort[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-abort "Direct link to abort")

Added before v1.9
route.abort

Aborts the route's request.

**Usage**

```
await route.abort();
await route.abort(errorCode);
```

**Arguments**

* `errorCode` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-abort-option-error-code)

  Optional error code. Defaults to `failed`, could be one of the following:

  + `'aborted'` - An operation was aborted (due to user action)
  + `'accessdenied'` - Permission to access a resource, other than the network, was denied
  + `'addressunreachable'` - The IP address is unreachable. This usually means that there is no route to the specified host or network.
  + `'blockedbyclient'` - The client chose to block the request.
  + `'blockedbyresponse'` - The request failed because the response was delivered along with requirements which are not met ('X-Frame-Options' and 'Content-Security-Policy' ancestor checks, for instance).
  + `'connectionaborted'` - A connection timed out as a result of not receiving an ACK for data sent.
  + `'connectionclosed'` - A connection was closed (corresponding to a TCP FIN).

### continue[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue "Direct link to continue")

Added before v1.9
route.continue

Sends route's request to the network with optional overrides.

**Usage**

```
await page.route('**/*', async (route, request) => {
  // Override headers
  const headers = {
    ...request.headers(),
    foo: 'foo-value', // set "foo" header
    bar: undefined, // remove "bar" header
  };
  await route.continue({ headers });
});
```

**Arguments**

* `options` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object") *(optional)*
  + `headers` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")<[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string"), [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")> *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-headers)

    If set changes the request HTTP headers. Header values will be converted to a string.
  + `method` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-method)

    If set changes the request method (e.g. GET or POST).
  + `postData` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") | [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer "Buffer") | [Serializable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Description "Serializable") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-post-data)

    If set changes the post data of request.
  + `url` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-url)

    If set changes the request URL. New URL must have same protocol as original one.

**Returns**

* [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise")<[void](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined "void")>[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-return)

**Details**

The [headers](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-headers) option applies to both the routed request and any redirects it initiates. However, [url](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-url), [method](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-method), and [postData](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue-option-post-data) only apply to the original request and are not carried over to redirected requests.

[route.continue()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue) will immediately send the request to the network, other matching handlers won't be invoked. Use [route.fallback()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-fallback) If you want next matching handler in the chain to be invoked.

warning

The `Cookie` header cannot be overridden using this method. If a value is provided, it will be ignored, and the cookie will be loaded from the browser's cookie store. To set custom cookies, use [browserContext.addCookies()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext.html#browser-context-add-cookies).

---

### fallback[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-fallback "Direct link to fallback")

Added in: v1.23
route.fallback

Continues route's request with optional overrides. The method is similar to [route.continue()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue) with the difference that other matching handlers will be invoked before sending the request.

**Usage**

When several routes match the given pattern, they run in the order opposite to their registration. That way the last registered route can always override all the previous ones. In the example below, request will be handled by the bottom-most handler first, then it'll fall back to the previous one and in the end will be aborted by the first registered route.

```
await page.route('**/*', async route => {
  // Runs last.
  await route.abort();
});
await page.route('**/*', async route => {
  // Runs second.
  await route.fallback();
});
await page.route('**/*', async route => {
  // Runs first.
  await route.fallback();
});
```

Registering multiple routes is useful when you want separate handlers to handle different kinds of requests, for example API calls vs page resources or GET requests vs POST requests as in the example below.

```
// Handle GET requests.
await page.route('**/*', async route => {
  if (route.request().method() !== 'GET') {
    await route.fallback();
    return;
  }
  // Handling GET only.
  // ...
});

// Handle POST requests.
await page.route('**/*', async route => {
  if (route.request().method() !== 'POST') {
    await route.fallback();
    return;
  }
  // Handling POST only.
  // ...
});
```

One can also modify request while falling back to the subsequent handler, that way intermediate route handler can modify url, method, headers and postData of the request.

```
await page.route('**/*', async (route, request) => {
  // Override headers
  const headers = {
    ...request.headers(),
    foo: 'foo-value', // set "foo" header
    bar: undefined, // remove "bar" header
  };
  await route.fallback({ headers });
});
```

Use [route.continue()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-continue) to immediately send the request to the network, other matching handlers won't be invoked in that case.

**Arguments**

* `options` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object") *(optional)*
  + `headers` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")<[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string"), [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")> *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-fallback-option-headers)

    If set changes the request HTTP headers. Header values will be converted to a string.
  + `method` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-fallback-option-method)

    If set changes the request method (e.g. GET or POST).
  + `postData` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") | [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer "Buffer") | [Serializable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Description "Serializable") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-fallback-option-post-data)

    If set changes the post data of request.
  + `url` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-fallback-option-url)

    If set changes the request URL. New URL must have same protocol as original one. Changing the URL won't affect the route matching, all the routes are matched using the original request URL.

**Returns**

* [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise "Promise")<[void](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined "void")>[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-route.html#route-fallback-return)
