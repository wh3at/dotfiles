* * Migration* Migrating from Protractor

On this page

## Migration Principles[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/protractor.html#migration-principles "Direct link to Migration Principles")

* No need for "webdriver-manager" / Selenium.
* Protractor’s [ElementFinder](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ElementFinder) ⇄ [Playwright Test Locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locator.html)
* Protractor’s [`waitForAngular`](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ProtractorBrowser.prototype.waitForAngular) ⇄ Playwright Test [auto-waiting](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability.html)
* Don’t forget to await in Playwright Test

## Example[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/protractor.html#example "Direct link to Example")

Protractor:

```
describe('angularjs homepage todo list', function() {
  it('should add a todo', function() {
    browser.get('https://angularjs.org');

    element(by.model('todoList.todoText')).sendKeys('first test');
    element(by.css('[value="add"]')).click();

    const todoList = element.all(by.repeater('todo in todoList.todos'));
    expect(todoList.count()).toEqual(3);
    expect(todoList.get(2).getText()).toEqual('first test');

    // You wrote your first test, cross it off the list
    todoList.get(2).element(by.css('input')).click();
    const completedAmount = element.all(by.css('.done-true'));
    expect(completedAmount.count()).toEqual(2);
  });
});
```

Line-by-line migration to Playwright Test:

```
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test'); // 1

test.describe('angularjs homepage todo list', () => {
  test('should add a todo', async ({ page }) => { // 2, 3
    await page.goto('https://angularjs.org'); // 4

    await page.locator('[ng-model="todoList.todoText"]').fill('first test');
    await page.locator('[value="add"]').click();

    const todoList = page.locator('[ng-repeat="todo in todoList.todos"]'); // 5
    await expect(todoList).toHaveCount(3);
    await expect(todoList.nth(2)).toHaveText('first test', {
      useInnerText: true,
    });

    // You wrote your first test, cross it off the list
    await todoList.nth(2).getByRole('textbox').click();
    const completedAmount = page.locator('.done-true');
    await expect(completedAmount).toHaveCount(2);
  });
});
```

Migration highlights (see inline comments in the Playwright Test code snippet):

1. Each Playwright Test file has explicit import of the `test` and `expect` functions
2. Test function is marked with `async`
3. Playwright Test is given a `page` as one of its parameters. This is one of the many [useful fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-fixtures.html) in Playwright Test.
4. Almost all Playwright calls are prefixed with `await`
5. Locator creation with [page.locator()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page.html#page-locator) is one of the few methods that is sync.

## Polyfilling `waitForAngular`[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/protractor.html#polyfilling-waitforangular "Direct link to polyfilling-waitforangular")

Playwright Test has built-in [auto-waiting](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability.html) that makes protractor's [`waitForAngular`](https://www.protractortest.org/#/api?view=ProtractorBrowser.prototype.waitForAngular) unneeded in general case.

However, it might come handy in some edge cases. Here's how to polyfill `waitForAngular` function in Playwright Test:

1. Make sure you have protractor installed in your package.json
2. Polyfill function

   ```
   async function waitForAngular(page) {
     const clientSideScripts = require('protractor/built/clientsidescripts.js');

     async function executeScriptAsync(page, script, ...scriptArgs) {
       await page.evaluate(`
         new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           const callback = (errMessage) => {
             if (errMessage)
               reject(new Error(errMessage));
             else
               resolve();
           };
           (function() {${script}}).apply(null, [...${JSON.stringify(scriptArgs)}, callback]);
         })
       `);
     }

     await executeScriptAsync(page, clientSideScripts.waitForAngular, '');
   }
   ```

   If you don't want to keep a version protractor around, you can also use this simpler approach using this function (only works for Angular 2+):

   ```
   async function waitForAngular(page) {
     await page.evaluate(async () => {
       // @ts-expect-error
       if (window.getAllAngularTestabilities) {
         // @ts-expect-error
         await Promise.all(window.getAllAngularTestabilities().map(whenStable));
         // @ts-expect-error
         async function whenStable(testability) {
           return new Promise(res => testability.whenStable(res));
         }
       }
     });
   }
   ```
3. Polyfill usage

   ```
   const page = await context.newPage();
   await page.goto('https://example.org');
   await waitForAngular(page);
   ```
