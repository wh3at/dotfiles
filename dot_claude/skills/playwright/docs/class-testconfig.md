On this page

Playwright Test provides many options to configure how your tests are collected and executed, for example `timeout` or `testDir`. These options are described in the [TestConfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html "TestConfig") object in the [configuration file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html). This type describes format of the configuration file, to access resolved configuration parameters at run time use [FullConfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-fullconfig.html "FullConfig").

Playwright Test supports running multiple test projects at the same time. Project-specific options should be put to [testConfig.projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-projects), but top-level [TestConfig](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html "TestConfig") can also define base options shared between all projects.

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30000,
  globalTimeout: 600000,
  reporter: 'list',
  testDir: './tests',
});
```

### captureGitInfo[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-capture-git-info "Direct link to captureGitInfo")

Added in: v1.51
testConfig.captureGitInfo

These settings control whether git information is captured and stored in the config [testConfig.metadata](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-metadata).

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  captureGitInfo: { commit: true, diff: true }
});
```

**Type**

* [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")
  + `commit` [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type "Boolean") *(optional)*

  + `diff` [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type "Boolean") *(optional)*

    Whether to capture commit diff.

**Details**

* Capturing `commit` information is useful when you'd like to see it in your HTML (or a third party) report.
* Capturing `diff` information is useful to enrich the report with the actual source diff. This information can be used to provide intelligent advice on how to fix the test.

note

Default values for these settings depend on the environment. When tests run as a part of CI where it is safe to obtain git information, the default value is `true`, `false` otherwise.

note

The structure of the git commit metadata is subject to change.

### snapshotPathTemplate[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-snapshot-path-template "Direct link to snapshotPathTemplate")

Added in: v1.28
testConfig.snapshotPathTemplate

This option configures a template controlling location of snapshots generated by [expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-pageassertions.html#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-1), [expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-locatorassertions.html#locator-assertions-to-match-aria-snapshot-2) and [expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-snapshotassertions.html#snapshot-assertions-to-match-snapshot-1).

You can configure templates for each assertion separately in [testConfig.expect](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-expect).

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests',

  // Single template for all assertions
  snapshotPathTemplate: '{testDir}/__screenshots__/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',

  // Assertion-specific templates
  expect: {
    toHaveScreenshot: {
      pathTemplate: '{testDir}/__screenshots__{/projectName}/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',
    },
    toMatchAriaSnapshot: {
      pathTemplate: '{testDir}/__snapshots__/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',
    },
  },
});
```

**Type**

* [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

**Details**

The value might include some "tokens" that will be replaced with actual values during test execution.

Consider the following file structure:

```
playwright.config.ts
tests/
└── page/
    └── page-click.spec.ts
```

And the following `page-click.spec.ts` that uses `toHaveScreenshot()` call:

page-click.spec.ts

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('suite', () => {
  test('test should work', async ({ page }) => {
    await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(['foo', 'bar', 'baz.png']);
  });
});
```

The list of supported tokens:

* `{arg}` - Relative snapshot path **without extension**. This comes from the arguments passed to `toHaveScreenshot()`, `toMatchAriaSnapshot()` or `toMatchSnapshot()`; if called without arguments, this will be an auto-generated snapshot name.
  + Value: `foo/bar/baz`
* `{ext}` - Snapshot extension (with the leading dot).
  + Value: `.png`
* `{platform}` - The value of `process.platform`.
* `{projectName}` - Project's file-system-sanitized name, if any.
  + Value: `''` (empty string).
* `{snapshotDir}` - Project's [testProject.snapshotDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject.html#test-project-snapshot-dir).
  + Value: `/home/playwright/tests` (since `snapshotDir` is not provided in config, it defaults to `testDir`)
* `{testDir}` - Project's [testProject.testDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testproject.html#test-project-test-dir).
  + Value: `/home/playwright/tests` (absolute path since `testDir` is resolved relative to directory with config)
* `{testFileDir}` - Directories in relative path from `testDir` to **test file**.
  + Value: `page`
* `{testFileName}` - Test file name with extension.
  + Value: `page-click.spec.ts`
* `{testFilePath}` - Relative path from `testDir` to **test file**.
  + Value: `page/page-click.spec.ts`
* `{testName}` - File-system-sanitized test title, including parent describes but excluding file name.
  + Value: `suite-test-should-work`

Each token can be preceded with a single character that will be used **only if** this token has non-empty value.

Consider the following config:

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  snapshotPathTemplate: '__screenshots__{/projectName}/{testFilePath}/{arg}{ext}',
  testMatch: 'example.spec.ts',
  projects: [
    { use: { browserName: 'firefox' } },
    { name: 'chromium', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },
  ],
});
```

In this config:

1. First project **does not** have a name, so its snapshots will be stored in `<configDir>/__screenshots__/example.spec.ts/...`.
2. Second project **does** have a name, so its snapshots will be stored in `<configDir>/__screenshots__/chromium/example.spec.ts/..`.
3. Since `snapshotPathTemplate` resolves to relative path, it will be resolved relative to `configDir`.
4. Forward slashes `"/"` can be used as path separators on any platform.

---

### testIgnore[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-test-ignore "Direct link to testIgnore")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.testIgnore

Files matching one of these patterns are not executed as test files. Matching is performed against the absolute file path. Strings are treated as glob patterns.

For example, `'**/test-assets/**'` will ignore any files in the `test-assets` directory.

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testIgnore: '**/test-assets/**',
});

### testMatch[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-test-match "Direct link to testMatch")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.testMatch

Only the files matching one of these patterns are executed as test files. Matching is performed against the absolute file path. Strings are treated as glob patterns.

By default, Playwright looks for files matching the following glob pattern: `**/*.@(spec|test).?(c|m)[jt]s?(x)`. This means JavaScript or TypeScript files with `".test"` or `".spec"` suffix, for example `login-screen.wrong-credentials.spec.ts`.

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testMatch: /.*\.e2e\.js/,

---

### timeout[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-timeout "Direct link to timeout")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.timeout

Timeout for each test in milliseconds. Defaults to 30 seconds.

This is a base timeout for all tests. In addition, each test can configure its own timeout with [test.setTimeout()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test.html#test-set-timeout). Learn more about [various timeouts](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts.html).

**Usage**

Added in: v1.49
testConfig.tsconfig

Path to a single `tsconfig` applicable to all imported files. By default, `tsconfig` for each imported file is looked up separately. Note that `tsconfig` property has no effect while the configuration file or any of its dependencies are loaded. Ignored when `--tsconfig` command line option is specified.

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  tsconfig: './tsconfig.test.json',
});
```

**Type**

* [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

---

### updateSnapshots[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-update-snapshots "Direct link to updateSnapshots")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.updateSnapshots

Whether to update expected snapshots with the actual results produced by the test run. Defaults to `'missing'`.

* `'all'` - All tests that are executed will update snapshots.
* `'changed'` - All tests that are executed will update snapshots that did not match. Matching snapshots will not be updated. Also creates missing snapshots.
* `'missing'` - Missing snapshots are created, for example when authoring a new test and running it for the first time. This is the default.
* `'none'` - No snapshots are updated.

Learn more about [snapshots](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-snapshots.html).

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```

### updateSourceMethod[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-update-source-method "Direct link to updateSourceMethod")

Added in: v1.50
testConfig.updateSourceMethod

Defines how to update snapshots in the source code.

* `'patch'` - Create a unified diff file that can be used to update the source code later. This is the default.
* `'3way'` - Generate merge conflict markers in source code. This allows user to manually pick relevant changes, as if they are resolving a merge conflict in the IDE.
* `'overwrite'` - Overwrite the source code with the new snapshot values.

**Usage**

```
testConfig.updateSourceMethod
```

**Type**

* "overwrite" | "3way" | "patch"

---

### use[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-use "Direct link to use")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.use

Global options for all tests, for example [testOptions.browserName](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions.html#test-options-browser-name). Learn more about [configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration.html) and see [available options](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions.html "TestOptions").

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    browserName: 'chromium',
  },
});
```

**Type**

* [TestOptions](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions.html "TestOptions")

---

### webServer[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-web-server "Direct link to webServer")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.webServer

Launch a development web server (or multiple) during the tests.

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    timeout: 120 * 1000,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000/',
  },
});
```

Now you can use a relative path when navigating the page:

test.spec.ts

```
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  // This will result in http://localhost:3000/foo
  await page.goto('/foo');
});
```

Multiple web servers (or background processes) can be launched:

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: [
    {
      command: 'npm run start',
      url: 'http://localhost:3000',
      name: 'Frontend',
      timeout: 120 * 1000,
      reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    },
    {
      command: 'npm run backend',
      url: 'http://localhost:3333',
      name: 'Backend',
      timeout: 120 * 1000,
      reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    }
  ],
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  },
});
```

If your webserver runs on varying ports, use `wait` to capture the port:

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    wait: {
      stdout: '/Listening on port (?<my_server_port>\\d+)/'
    },
  },
});
```

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.use({ baseUrl: `http://localhost:${process.env.MY_SERVER_PORT ?? 3000}` });

test('homepage', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
});
```

  + `command` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

    Shell command to start. For example `npm run start`..
  + `cwd` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*

    Current working directory of the spawned process, defaults to the directory of the configuration file.
  + `env` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object")<[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string"), [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")> *(optional)*

    Environment variables to set for the command, `process.env` by default.
  + `gracefulShutdown` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object") *(optional)*

    - `signal` "SIGINT" | "SIGTERM"
    - `timeout` [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type "Number")

    How to shut down the process. If unspecified, the process group is forcefully `SIGKILL`ed. If set to `{ signal: 'SIGTERM', timeout: 500 }`, the process group is sent a `SIGTERM` signal, followed by `SIGKILL` if it doesn't exit within 500ms. You can also use `SIGINT` as the signal instead. A `0` timeout means no `SIGKILL` will be sent. Windows doesn't support `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals, so this option is ignored on Windows. Note that shutting down a Docker container requires `SIGTERM`.
  + `ignoreHTTPSErrors` [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type "Boolean") *(optional)*

    Whether to ignore HTTPS errors when fetching the `url`. Defaults to `false`.
  + `name` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*

    Specifies a custom name for the web server. This name will be prefixed to log messages. Defaults to `[WebServer]`.
  + `port` [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type "Number") *(optional)*

    The port that your http server is expected to appear on. It does wait until it accepts connections. Either `port` or `url` should be specified.
  + `reuseExistingServer` [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type "Boolean") *(optional)*

    If true, it will re-use an existing server on the `port` or `url` when available. If no server is running on that `port` or `url`, it will run the command to start a new server. If `false`, it will throw if an existing process is listening on the `port` or `url`. This should be commonly set to `!process.env.CI` to allow the local dev server when running tests locally.
  + `stderr` "pipe" | "ignore" *(optional)*

    Whether to pipe the stderr of the command to the process stderr or ignore it. Defaults to `"pipe"`.
  + `stdout` "pipe" | "ignore" *(optional)*

    If `"pipe"`, it will pipe the stdout of the command to the process stdout. If `"ignore"`, it will ignore the stdout of the command. Default to `"ignore"`.
  + `wait` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object") *(optional)*

    - `stdout` [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp "RegExp") *(optional)*

      Regular expression to wait for in the `stdout` of the command output. Named capture groups are stored in the environment, for example `/Listening on port (?<my_server_port>\\d+)/` will store the port number in `process.env['MY_SERVER_PORT']`.
    - `stderr` [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp "RegExp") *(optional)*

      Regular expression to wait for in the `stderr` of the command output. Named capture groups are stored in the environment, for example `/Listening on port (?<my_server_port>\\d+)/` will store the port number in `process.env['MY_SERVER_PORT']`.

    Consider command started only when given output has been produced.
  + `timeout` [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type "Number") *(optional)*

    How long to wait for the process to start up and be available in milliseconds. Defaults to 60000.
  + `url` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*

    The url on your http server that is expected to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or 403 status code when the server is ready to accept connections. Redirects (3xx status codes) are being followed and the new location is checked. Either `port` or `url` should be specified.

**Details**

If the port is specified, Playwright Test will wait for it to be available on `127.0.0.1` or `::1`, before running the tests. If the url is specified, Playwright Test will wait for the URL to return a 2xx, 3xx, 400, 401, 402, or 403 status code before running the tests.

For continuous integration, you may want to use the `reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI` option which does not use an existing server on the CI. To see the stdout, you can set the `DEBUG=pw:webserver` environment variable.

The `port` (but not the `url`) gets passed over to Playwright as a [testOptions.baseURL](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions.html#test-options-base-url). For example port `8080` produces `baseURL` equal `http://localhost:8080`. If `webServer` is specified as an array, you must explicitly configure the `baseURL` (even if it only has one entry).

note

It is also recommended to specify [testOptions.baseURL](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions.html#test-options-base-url) in the config, so that tests could use relative urls.

### workers[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-workers "Direct link to workers")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.workers

The maximum number of concurrent worker processes to use for parallelizing tests. Can also be set as percentage of logical CPU cores, e.g. `'50%'.`

Playwright Test uses worker processes to run tests. There is always at least one worker process, but more can be used to speed up test execution.

Defaults to half of the number of logical CPU cores. Learn more about [parallelism and sharding](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel.html) with Playwright Test.

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  workers: 3,
});
```

**Type**

* [number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Number_type "Number") | [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

### snapshotDir[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-snapshot-dir "Direct link to snapshotDir")

Added in: v1.10
testConfig.snapshotDir

Discouraged

Use [testConfig.snapshotPathTemplate](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-snapshot-path-template) to configure snapshot paths.

The base directory, relative to the config file, for snapshot files created with `toMatchSnapshot`. Defaults to [testConfig.testDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testconfig.html#test-config-test-dir).

**Usage**

playwright.config.ts

```
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  snapshotDir: './snapshots',
});
```

**Type**

* [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")

**Details**

The directory for each test can be accessed by [testInfo.snapshotDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-snapshot-dir) and [testInfo.snapshotPath()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-snapshot-path).

This path will serve as the base directory for each test file snapshot directory. Setting `snapshotDir` to `'snapshots'`, the [testInfo.snapshotDir](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-snapshot-dir) would resolve to `snapshots/a.spec.js-snapshots`.
