## Introduction[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/languages.html#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")

Playwright is available in multiple languages that share the same underlying implementation. All core features for automating the browser are supported in all languages, while testing ecosystem integration is different. Pick the language based on your experience, familiarity with its testing ecosystem and your project constraints. For the best experience pick the test runner that we recommend for each language.

Playwright for Node.js comes with its own [test runner](https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests.html) that provides great parallelization mechanism, screenshot assertions, html reporter, automatic tracing etc.

Playwright [Pytest plugin](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-runners) is the recommended way to run end-to-end tests. It provides context isolation, running it on multiple browser configurations and more out of the box.
