* * API reference* Test Runner* TestStepInfo

On this page

`TestStepInfo` contains information about currently running test step. It is passed as an argument to the step function. `TestStepInfo` provides utilities to control test step execution.

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page, browserName }) => {
  await test.step('check some behavior', async step => {
    step.skip(browserName === 'webkit', 'The feature is not available in WebKit');
    // ... rest of the step code
  });
});
```

## Methods[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#methods "Direct link to Methods")

### attach[​](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach "Direct link to attach")

Added in: v1.51
testStepInfo.attach

Attach a value or a file from disk to the current test step. Some reporters show test step attachments. Either [path](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach-option-path) or [body](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach-option-body) must be specified, but not both. Calling this method will attribute the attachment to the step, as opposed to [testInfo.attach()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testinfo.html#test-info-attach) which stores all attachments at the test level.

For example, you can attach a screenshot to the test step:

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('basic test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
  await test.step('check page rendering', async step => {
    const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
    await step.attach('screenshot', { body: screenshot, contentType: 'image/png' });
  });
});
```

Or you can attach files returned by your APIs:

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { download } from './my-custom-helpers';

test('basic test', async ({}) => {
  await test.step('check download behavior', async step => {
    const tmpPath = await download('a');
    await step.attach('downloaded', { path: tmpPath });
  });
});
```

note

[testStepInfo.attach()](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach) automatically takes care of copying attached files to a location that is accessible to reporters. You can safely remove the attachment after awaiting the attach call.

**Usage**

```
await testStepInfo.attach(name);
await testStepInfo.attach(name, options);
```

**Arguments**

* `name` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string")[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach-option-name)

  Attachment name. The name will also be sanitized and used as the prefix of file name when saving to disk.
* `options` [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object "Object") *(optional)*

  + `body` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") | [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer "Buffer") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach-option-body)

    Content type of this attachment to properly present in the report, for example `'application/json'` or `'image/png'`. If omitted, content type is inferred based on the [path](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach-option-path), or defaults to `text/plain` for [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") attachments and `application/octet-stream` for [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_buffer "Buffer") attachments.
  + `path` [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#String_type "string") *(optional)*[#](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach-option-path)

    Path on the filesystem to the attached file. Mutually exclusive with [body](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-teststepinfo.html#test-step-info-attach-option-body).

Added in: v1.51
testStepInfo.skip()

Abort the currently running step and mark it as skipped. Useful for steps that are currently failing and planned for a near-term fix.

**Usage**

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('my test', async ({ page }) => {

testStepInfo.skip(condition)

Conditionally abort the currently running step and mark it as skipped with an optional description. Useful for steps that should not be executed in some cases.

**Usage**

```
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('my test', async ({ page, isMobile }) => {
  await test.step('check desktop expectations', async step => {

    // step body below will not run
    // ...

  Optional description that will be reflected in a test report.
