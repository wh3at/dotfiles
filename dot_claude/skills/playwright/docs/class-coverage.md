* * API reference* Classes* Coverage

On this page

Coverage gathers information about parts of JavaScript and CSS that were used by the page.

An example of using JavaScript coverage to produce Istanbul report for page load:

note

Coverage APIs are only supported on Chromium-based browsers.

```
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
const v8toIstanbul = require('v8-to-istanbul');

(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.coverage.startJSCoverage();
  await page.goto('https://chromium.org');
  const coverage = await page.coverage.stopJSCoverage();
  for (const entry of coverage) {
    const converter = v8toIstanbul('', 0, { source: entry.source });
    await converter.load();
    converter.applyCoverage(entry.functions);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(converter.toIstanbul()));
  }
  await browser.close();
})();
```
