The Playground UI is a simple way to test, debug, and develop with the agent.

* Pick a user to list their threads.
* Browse the user's threads.
* List the selected thread's messages, along with tool call details.
* Show message metadata details.
* Experiment with contextual message lookup, adjusting context options.
* Send a message to the thread, with configurable saving options.
* It uses api keys to communicate securely with the backend.

There is also a [hosted version here](https://get-convex.github.io/agent/).

## Setup[​](https://docs.convex.dev/agents/playground.html#setup "Direct link to Setup")

**Note**: You must already have a Convex project set up with the Agent. See the
[docs](https://docs.convex.dev/agents/getting-started.html) for setup instructions.

In your agent Convex project, make a file `convex/playground.ts` with:

```
import { definePlaygroundAPI } from "@convex-dev/agent";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { weatherAgent, fashionAgent } from "./example";

/**
 * Here we expose the API so the frontend can access it.
 * Authorization is handled by passing up an apiKey that can be generated
 * on the dashboard or via CLI via:
 * npx convex run --component agent apiKeys:issue
 */
export const {
  isApiKeyValid,
  listAgents,
  listUsers,
  listThreads,
  listMessages,
  createThread,
  generateText,
  fetchPromptContext,
} = definePlaygroundAPI(components.agent, {
  agents: [weatherAgent, fashionAgent],
});
```

From in your project's repo, issue yourself an API key:

```
npx convex run --component agent apiKeys:issue '{name:"..."}'
```

Note: to generate multiple keys, give a different name to each key. To revoke
and reissue a key, pass the same name.

Then visit the [hosted version](https://get-convex.github.io/agent/).

It will ask for your Convex deployment URL, which can be found in `.env.local`.
It will also ask for your API key that you generated above. If you used a
different path for `convex/playground.ts` you can enter it. E.g. if you had
`convex/foo/bar.ts` where you exported the playground API, you'd put in
`foo/bar`.

## Running it locally[​](https://docs.convex.dev/agents/playground.html#running-it-locally "Direct link to Running it locally")

You can run the playground locally with:

```
npx @convex-dev/agent-playground
```

It uses the `VITE_CONVEX_URL` env variable, usually pulling it from .env.local.
