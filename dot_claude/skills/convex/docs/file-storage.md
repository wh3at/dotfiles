The [file storage page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/files) displays
[files stored in your deployment](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage.html). The page also shows the
files' storage IDs, size, and content type. You can upload new files and
download or delete existing files.

Storage IDs might be referenced by documents in your database.

tip

When new files are uploaded, the UI will reference the name of the recently
uploaded file. However, these names are not persisted and will no longer appear
when the page is reloaded.
