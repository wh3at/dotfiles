[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is a powerful web framework powered by Vue.

The community-maintained
[`convex-nuxt` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convex-nuxt) provides
deep integration of Convex with the Nuxt 3 ecosystem.

It uses [convex-vue](https://docs.convex.dev/client/vue.html) under the hood.

See the [Nuxt Quickstart](https://docs.convex.dev/quickstart/nuxt.html) to get started or the
[convex-nuxt GitHub page](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-nuxt) for more
documentation.

info

The
[`convex-nuxt` library](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-nuxt/tree/main)
is community-maintained. Thank you to the maintainer
[Chris Visser](https://github.com/chris-visser) for his work on this project!

You're welcome to ask questions about the library on the
[Convex Discord](https://convex.dev/community) but opening a
[convex-nuxt GitHub](https://github.com/chris-visser/convex-nuxt) issue is a
better way to request a new feature or report a bug.
