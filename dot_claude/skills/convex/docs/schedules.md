The [schedules page](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/schedules) displays
all [scheduled functions](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions.html) and
[cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs.html) in your deployment. Use the tabs at the
top of this page to switch between scheduled functions and cron jobs.

## Scheduled functions UI[​](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/schedules.html#scheduled-functions-ui "Direct link to Scheduled functions UI")

The scheduled functions UI shows a list of all upcoming function invocation.
From here, you can filter to scheduled runs for a specific function, and cancel
scheduled functions runs.
