Convex makes it easy to test your app via automated tests running in JS or
against a real backend, and manually in dev, preview and staging environments.

## Automated tests[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#automated-tests "Direct link to Automated tests")

### `convex-test` library[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#convex-test-library "Direct link to convex-test-library")

[Use the `convex-test` library](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-test.html) to test your functions
in JS via the excellent Vitest testing framework.

### Testing against a real backend[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#testing-against-a-real-backend "Direct link to Testing against a real backend")

Convex open source builds allow you to test all of your backend logic running on
a real [local Convex backend](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/convex-backend.html).

### Set up testing in CI[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#set-up-testing-in-ci "Direct link to Set up testing in CI")

It's a good idea to test your app continuously in a controlled environment. No
matter which way automated method you use, it's easy to run them with
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.convex.dev/testing/ci.html).

## Manual tests[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#manual-tests "Direct link to Manual tests")

### Running a function in dev[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#running-a-function-in-dev "Direct link to Running a function in dev")

Manually run a function in dev to quickly see if things are working:

* [Run functions from the command line](https://docs.convex.dev/using/cli.html#run-convex-functions)
* [Run functions from the dashboard](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions.html#running-functions)

### Preview deployments[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#preview-deployments "Direct link to Preview deployments")

[Use preview deployments](https://docs.convex.dev/production/hosting/preview-deployments.html) to get
early feedback from your team for your in-progress features.

### Staging environment[​](https://docs.convex.dev/testing.html#staging-environment "Direct link to Staging environment")

You can set up a separate project as a staging environment to test against. See
[Deploying Your App to Production](https://docs.convex.dev/production.html#staging-environment).
