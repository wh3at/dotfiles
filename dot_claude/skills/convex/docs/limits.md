We’d love for you to have *unlimited* joy building on Convex but engineering
practicalities dictate a few limits. This page outlines current limits in the
Convex ecosystem.

Many of these limits will become more permissive over time. Please get in touch
if any are prohibitive for your application.

Limits are applied per team unless stated otherwise.

  underscore.

## Documents[​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits.html#documents "Direct link to Documents")

* Field names must only contain non-control alphanumeric ASCII characters and
  underscores and must start with an alphabetic character or underscore.
* Documents cannot contain top-level fields that start with an underscore, other
  than the system-provided `_id` and `_creationTime` fields.

## Concurrent Function Executions[​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits.html#concurrent-function-executions "Direct link to Concurrent Function Executions")

\* Limits can be lifted for Professional plan customers on a
case-by-case basis. Send us support message through the dashboard to discuss
your needs. Usually this is only needed if your product has highly bursty
traffic.

## Execution time and scheduling[​](https://docs.convex.dev/production/state/limits.html#execution-time-and-scheduling "Direct link to Execution time and scheduling")

If any of these limits don't work for you,
[let us know](https://convex.dev/community)!

Please see our [plans and pricing page](https://www.convex.dev/pricing) for
resource limits. After these limits are hit on a free plan, new mutations that
attempt to commit more insertions or updates may fail. Paid plans have no hard
resource limits - they can scale to billions of documents and TBs of storage.
