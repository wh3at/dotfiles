You have followed one of our authentication guides but something is not working.
You have double checked that you followed all the steps, and that you used the
correct secrets, but you are still stuck.

## Frequently encountered issues[​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#frequently-encountered-issues "Direct link to Frequently encountered issues")

### `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` returns `null` in a query[​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#ctxauthgetuseridentity-returns-null-in-a-query "Direct link to ctxauthgetuseridentity-returns-null-in-a-query")

This often happens when subscribing to queries via `useQuery` in React, without
waiting for the client to be authenticated. Even if the user has been logged-in
previously, it takes some time for the client to authenticate with the Convex
backend. Therefore on page load, `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` called within a
query returns `null`.

To handle this, you can either:

1. Use the `Authenticated` component from `convex/react` to wrap the component
   that includes the `useQuery` call (see the last two steps in the
   [Clerk guide](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/clerk.html#get-started))
2. Or return `null` or some other "sentinel" value from the query and handle it
   on the client

If you are using `fetchQuery` for
[Next.js Server Rendering](https://docs.convex.dev/client/nextjs/app-router/server-rendering.html), make
sure you are explicitly passing in a JWT token as documented
[here](https://docs.convex.dev/client/nextjs/app-router/server-rendering.html#server-side-authentication).

If this hasn't helped, follow the steps below to resolve your issue.

## Step 1: Check whether authentication works on the backend[​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#step-1-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-backend "Direct link to Step 1: Check whether authentication works on the backend")

1. Add the following code to the *beginning* of your function (query, mutation,
   action or http action):

```
console.log("server identity", await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity());
```

2. Then call this function from whichever client you're using to talk to Convex.
3. Open the
   [logs page on your dashboard](https://dashboard.convex.dev/deployment/logs).
4. What do you see on the logs page?

   **Answer: I don't see anything**:

   * Potential cause: You don't have the right dashboard open. Confirm that the
     Deployment URL on *Settings* > *URL and Deploy Key* page matches how your
     client is configured.
   * Potential cause: Your client is not connected to Convex. Check your client
     logs (browser logs) for errors. Reload the page / restart the client.
   * Potential cause: The code has not been pushed. For dev deployments make
     sure you have `npx convex dev` running. For prod deployments make sure you
     successfully pushed via `npx convex deploy`. Go to the *Functions* page on
     the dashboard and check that the code shown there includes the
     `console.log` line you added.

   When you resolved the cause you should see the log appear.

   **Answer: I see a log with `'server identity' null`**:

   * Potential cause: The client is not supplying an auth token.
   * Potential cause: Your deployment is misconfigured.
   * Potential cause: Your client is misconfigured.

   Proceed to
   [step 2](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#step-2-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-frontend).

   **Answer: I see a log with `'server identity' { tokenIdentifier: '... }`**

   Great, you are all set!

## Step 2: Check whether authentication works on the frontend[​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#step-2-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-frontend "Direct link to Step 2: Check whether authentication works on the frontend")

No matter which client you use, it must pass a JWT token to your backend for
authentication to work.

The most bullet-proof way of ensuring your client is passing the token to the
backend, is to inspect the traffic between them.

1. If you're using a client from the web browser, open the *Network* tab in your
   browser's developer tools.
2. Check the token

   * For Websocket-based clients (`ConvexReactClient` and `ConvexClient`),
     filter for the `sync` name and select `WS` as the type of traffic. Check
     the `sync` items. After the client is initialized (commonly after loading
     the page), it will send a message (check the *Messages* tab) with
     `type: "Authenticate"`, and `value` will be the authentication token.

     ![Network tab inspecting Websocket messages](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/auth-ws.png)
   * For HTTP based clients (`ConvexHTTPClient` and the
     [HTTP API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api/index.html)), select `Fetch/XHR` as the type of traffic.
     You should see an individual network request for each function call, with
     an `Authorization` header with value `Bearer`  followed by the
     authentication token.

     ![Network tab inspecting HTTP headers](https://docs.convex.dev/screenshots/auth-http.png)
3. Do you see the authentication token in the traffic?

   **Answer: No**:

   * Potential cause: The Convex client is not configured to get/fetch a JWT
     token. You're not using
     `ConvexProviderWithClerk`/`ConvexProviderWithAuth0`/`ConvexProviderWithAuth`
     with the `ConvexReactClient` or you forgot to call `setAuth` on
     `ConvexHTTPClient` or `ConvexClient`.
   * Potential cause: You are not signed in, so the token is `null` or
     `undefined` and the `ConvexReactClient` skipped authentication altogether.
     Verify that you are signed in via `console.log`ing the token from whichever
     auth provider you are using:

     + Clerk:

       ```
       // import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs"; // for Next.js
       import { useAuth } from "@clerk/clerk-react";

       const { getToken } = useAuth();
       console.log(getToken({ template: "convex" }));
       ```
     + Auth0:

       ```
       import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

       const { getAccessTokenSilently } = useAuth0();
       const response = await getAccessTokenSilently({
         detailedResponse: true,
       });
       const token = response.id_token;
       console.log(token);
       ```
     + Custom: However you implemented `useAuthFromProviderX`

     If you don't see a long string that looks like a token, check the browser
     logs for errors from your auth provider. If there are none, check the
     Network tab to see whether requests to your provider are failing. Perhaps
     the auth provider is misconfigured. Double check the auth provider
     configuration (in the corresponding React provider or however your auth
     provider is configured for the client). Try clearing your cookies in the
     browser (in dev tools *Application* > *Cookies* > *Clear all cookies*
     button).

   **Answer: Yes, I see a long string that looks like a JWT**:

   Great, copy the whole token (there can be `.`s in it, so make sure you're not
   copying just a portion of it).
4. Open <https://jwt.io/>, scroll down and paste the token in the Encoded textarea
   on the left of the page. On the right you should see:

   * In *HEADER*, `"typ": "JWT"`
   * in *PAYLOAD*, a valid JSON with at least `"aud"`, `"iss"` and `"sub"`
     fields. If you see gibberish in the payload you probably didn't copy the
     token correctly or it's not a valid JWT token.

   If you see a valid JWT token, repeat
   [step 1](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#step-1-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-backend). If you
   still don't see correct identity, proceed to step 3.

## Step 3: Check that backend configuration matches frontend configuration[​](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#step-3-check-that-backend-configuration-matches-frontend-configuration "Direct link to Step 3: Check that backend configuration matches frontend configuration")

You have a valid JWT token on the frontend, and you know that it is being passed
to the backend, but the backend is not validating it.

1. Open the *Settings* > *Authentication* on your dashboard. What do you see?

   **Answer: I see
   `This deployment has no configured authentication providers`**:

   * Cause: You do not have an `auth.config.ts` (or `auth.config.js`) file in
     your `convex` directory, or you haven't pushed your code. Follow the
     authentication guide to create a valid auth config file. For dev
     deployments make sure you have `npx convex dev` running. For prod
     deployments make sure you successfully pushed via `npx convex deploy`.

   \*\*Answer: I see one or more *Domain* and *Application ID* pairs.

Great, let's check they match the JWT token.

2. Look at the `iss` field in the JWT token payload at <https://jwt.io/>. Does it
   match a *Domain* on the *Authentication* page?

   **Answer: No, I don't see the `iss` URL on the Convex dashboard**:

   * Potential cause: You copied the wrong value into your

     `auth.config.ts`

     's `domain`, or into the environment variable that is used there. Go back
     to the authentication guide and make sure you have the right URL from your
     auth provider.
   * Potential cause: Your client is misconfigured:

     + Clerk: You have the wrong `publishableKey` configured. The key must
       belong to the Clerk instance that you used to configure your

       `auth.config.ts`.

       - Also make sure that the JWT token in Clerk is called `convex`, as
         that's the name `ConvexProviderWithClerk` uses to fetch the token!
     + Auth0: You have the wrong `domain` configured (on the client!). The
       domain must belong to the Auth0 instance that you used to configure your
       `auth.config.ts`.
     + Custom: Make sure that your client is correctly configured to match your
       `auth.config.ts`.

   **Answer: Yes, I do see the `iss` URL**:

   Great, let's move one.
3. Look at the `aud` field in the JWT token payload at <https://jwt.io/>. Does it
   match the *Application ID* under the correct *Domain* on the *Authentication*
   page?

   **Answer: No, I don't see the `aud` value in the *Application ID* field**:

   * Potential cause: You copied the wrong value into your
     `auth.config.ts`
     's `applicationID`, or into the environment variable that is used there. Go
     back to the authentication guide and make sure you have the right value
     from your auth provider.
   * Potential cause: Your client is misconfigured:
     + Clerk: You have the wrong `publishableKey` configured.The key must belong
       to the Clerk instance that you used to configure your
       `auth.config.ts`.
     + Auth0: You have the wrong `clientId` configured. Make sure you're using
       the right `clientId` for the Auth0 instance that you used to configure
       your `auth.config.ts`.
     + Custom: Make sure that your client is correctly configured to match your
       `auth.config.ts`.

   **Answer: Yes, I do see the `aud` value in the *Application ID* field**:

   Great, repeat
   [step 1](https://docs.convex.dev/auth/debug.html#step-1-check-whether-authentication-works-on-the-backend) and you
   should be all set!
