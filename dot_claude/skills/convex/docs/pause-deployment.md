Pausing a deployment is a way to "turn off" a deployment without deleting any
data. This can be useful if you have an action that is blowing through a
third-party API quota and you just need a big red stop button.

When a deployment is paused:

* New function calls will return an error.
* Scheduled jobs will queue and run when the deployment is resumed.
* Cron jobs will be skipped.
* Everything else (e.g. code push, dashboard edits) should work as usual.

**This is important!** All new function calls will return an error when a
deployment is paused, so if you are running an app in production you may want to
consider alternatives like pushing code that disables a feature you are trying
to "turn off". We recommend testing this feature in a dev deployment first
before pausing a production deployment.

A deployment can be resumed with this button on the same page:
