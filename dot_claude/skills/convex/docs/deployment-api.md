The public interface of a Convex deployment is defined by the functions defined
in files in a convex folder.

The public HTTP endpoints of every Convex deployment consist of custom HTTP
endpoints defined by [HTTP Actions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions.html) and a
static [public HTTP API](https://docs.convex.dev/http-api/index.html).

Deployments also provide private endpoints only for the administrators of that
deployment:

* [Streaming export API](https://docs.convex.dev/streaming-export-api.html)
* [Streaming import API](https://docs.convex.dev/streaming-import-api.html)
* [Platform APIs](https://docs.convex.dev/deployment-platform-api.html)
