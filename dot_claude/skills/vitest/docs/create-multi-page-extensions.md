## [Anchor to How it works](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/create-multi-page-extensions#how-it-works)How it works

You can use a [checkout UI extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/thank-you-order-status) to add custom content across multiple pages of checkout.

Depending on the page and state of Shopify’s internal order processing, the targets and APIs available to extensions can vary.

A multi-page extension can be used to add custom content such as final sale details, upsells, surveys and more. The following examples demonstrate how to use targets to target different parts of the flow, depending on your use case.

## [Anchor to Pre-purchase](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/create-multi-page-extensions#pre-purchase)Pre-purchase

You can configure a UI extension to display before a purchase is completed by using the `purchase.checkout.cart-line-item.render-after` extension target. This means that merchants can place the extension on the information, payment and shipping steps of checkout (pre-purchase).

## [Anchor to Post-purchase](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/create-multi-page-extensions#post-purchase)Post-purchase

You can configure an extension to display after a purchase is completed by using both the `purchase.thank-you.cart-line-item.render-after` and `customer-account.order-status.cart-line-item.render-after` extension targets. This means that merchants can place the extension on the **Thank you** and **Order status** pages (post-purchase).

## [Anchor to Pre and post purchase](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/create-multi-page-extensions#pre-and-post-purchase)Pre and post purchase

You can configure an extension to display on all areas of the checkout by combining the `purchase.checkout.cart-line-item.render-after`, `purchase.thank-you.cart-line-item.render-after` and `customer-account.order-status.cart-line-item.render-after` extension targets.

## [Anchor to Testing the extension in the checkout editor](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/create-multi-page-extensions#testing-the-extension-in-the-checkout-editor)Testing the extension in the checkout editor

1. Follow the guide to [test an extension in the editor](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/checkout/test-checkout-ui-extensions#test-the-extension-in-the-checkout-editor)
2. Use the dropdown list at the top of the page to navigate to the **Thank you** and **Order status** pages.

Note

In a future release, we'll improve the extension installation in the editor to enable merchants to add an extension to multiple pages at once and share configuration between each placements.
