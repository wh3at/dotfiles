# Mocking Classes [​](https://vitest.dev/guide/mocking/classes.html#mocking-classes)

You can mock an entire class with a single [`vi.fn`](https://vitest.dev/api/vi#fn) call.

ts

```
class Dog {
  name: string

  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name
  }

  static getType(): string {
    return 'animal'
  }

  greet = (): string => {
    return `Hi! My name is ${this.name}!`
  }

  speak(): string {
    return 'bark!'
  }

  isHungry() {}
  feed() {}
}
```

We can re-create this class with `vi.fn` (or `vi.spyOn().mockImplementation()`):

ts

```
const Dog = vi.fn(class {
  static getType = vi.fn(() => 'mocked animal')

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  greet = vi.fn(() => `Hi! My name is ${this.name}!`)
  speak = vi.fn(() => 'loud bark!')
  feed = vi.fn()
})
```

WARNING

If a non-primitive is returned from the constructor function, that value will become the result of the new expression. In this case the `[[Prototype]]` may not be correctly bound:

ts

```
const CorrectDogClass = vi.fn(function (name) {
  this.name = name
})

const IncorrectDogClass = vi.fn(name => ({
  name
}))

const Marti = new CorrectDogClass('Marti')
const Newt = new IncorrectDogClass('Newt')

Marti instanceof CorrectDogClass // ✅ true
Newt instanceof IncorrectDogClass // ❌ false!
```

If you are mocking classes, prefer the class syntax over the function.

WHEN TO USE?

Generally speaking, you would re-create a class like this inside the module factory if the class is re-exported from another module:

ts

```
import { Dog } from './dog.js'

vi.mock(import('./dog.js'), () => {
  const Dog = vi.fn(class {
    feed = vi.fn()
    // ... other mocks
  })
  return { Dog }
})
```

This method can also be used to pass an instance of a class to a function that accepts the same interface:

src/feed.ts

ts

```
function feed(dog: Dog) {
  // ...
}
```

tests/dog.test.ts

ts

```
import { expect, test, vi } from 'vitest'
import { feed } from '../src/feed.js'

const Dog = vi.fn(class {
  feed = vi.fn()
})

test('can feed dogs', () => {
  const dogMax = new Dog('Max')

  feed(dogMax)

  expect(dogMax.feed).toHaveBeenCalled()
  expect(dogMax.isHungry()).toBe(false)
})
```

Now, when we create a new instance of the `Dog` class its `speak` method (alongside `feed` and `greet`) is already mocked:

ts

```
const Cooper = new Dog('Cooper')
Cooper.speak() // loud bark!
Cooper.greet() // Hi! My name is Cooper!

// you can use built-in assertions to check the validity of the call
expect(Cooper.speak).toHaveBeenCalled()
expect(Cooper.greet).toHaveBeenCalled()

const Max = new Dog('Max')

// methods are not shared between instances if you assigned them directly
expect(Max.speak).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
expect(Max.greet).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
```

We can reassign the return value for a specific instance:

ts

```
const dog = new Dog('Cooper')

// "vi.mocked" is a type helper, since
// TypeScript doesn't know that Dog is a mocked class,
// it wraps any function in a Mock<T> type
// without validating if the function is a mock
vi.mocked(dog.speak).mockReturnValue('woof woof')

dog.speak() // woof woof
```

To mock the property, we can use the `vi.spyOn(dog, 'name', 'get')` method. This makes it possible to use spy assertions on the mocked property:

ts

```
const dog = new Dog('Cooper')

const nameSpy = vi.spyOn(dog, 'name', 'get').mockReturnValue('Max')

expect(dog.name).toBe('Max')
expect(nameSpy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
```

TIP

You can also spy on getters and setters using the same method.

DANGER

Using classes with `vi.fn()` was introduced in Vitest 4. Previously, you had to use `function` and `prototype` inheritence directly. See [v3 guide](https://v3.vitest.dev/guide/mocking#classes).
