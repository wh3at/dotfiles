You can configure your apps locally with TOML files, then [deploy your changes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-deploy) using Shopify CLI.
You can also configure many of these values through the [Dev Dashboard](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/dev-dashboard).

Changes to the `shopify.app.toml` are applied automatically during [`app dev`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-dev) for your chosen developmment store. For app configuration changes to take effect for all stores in production, you need to run the [`deploy` command](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-deploy).

Note

Changes to the `shopify.app.toml` are applied automatically during [`app dev`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-dev) for your chosen developmment store. For app configuration changes to take effect for all stores in production, you need to run the [`deploy` command](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-deploy).

| Property | Required? | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Yes | `string` | The name of your app. |
| `handle` | No | `string` | The URL slug of your app home, for example `https://admin.shopify.com/store/your-store-name/apps/your-app-handle/app`. |
| `client_id` | Yes | `string` | The app's public identifier. |
| `application_url` | Yes | `string` matching a valid URL | The URL of your app. |
| `embedded` | Yes | `boolean` | Embedded apps let users interact with your app without leaving the context of Shopify. |
| `extension_directories` | No | `array` of `string` paths or glob patterns | The paths that Shopify CLI will search for app [extensions](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-structure#extensions). |
| `web_directories` | No | `array` of `string` paths or glob patterns | The paths that Shopify CLI will search for the [web files](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-structure#web-files) of your app. |

### [Anchor to access\_scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#access_scopes)access\_scopes

Define the permissions your app requests, as well as how the permissions are requested.

Note

Changes to the `shopify.app.toml` are applied automatically during [`app dev`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-dev) for your chosen developmment store. For app configuration changes to take effect for all stores in production, you need to run the [`deploy` command](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-deploy).

| Property | Required? | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scopes` | Yes | `string` matching a comma-separated list of scopes | Any [access scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/access-scopes) that your app will request access to during the authorization process. |

Learn how to [manage access scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/app-installation/manage-access-scopes) for your app. |
| `use_legacy_install_flow` | No | boolean | When omitted or `false`, scopes are saved in your app's configuration, and are automatically requested when the app is installed on a store or when you update the `scopes` value. This is referred to as [Shopify managed installation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/app-installation).    When `true`, the legacy installation flow requests scopes through a URL parameter during the [OAuth flow](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/authentication-authorization/access-tokens/authorization-code-grant). The legacy installation flow is still supported, but isn't recommended because your app can end up with different scopes for each installation. |

## [Anchor to Migrate from config push](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#migrate-from-config-push)Migrate from config push

The `shopify app config push` Shopify CLI command is no longer supported. Instead, you can release your app configuration and extensions together with the [`deploy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/app/app-deploy) command.

### [Anchor to Migrate interactively](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#migrate-interactively)Migrate interactively

If you use the `shopify app config push` command without the `--force` flag, then follow these steps to migrate to the `deploy` command:

1. [Upgrade Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli#upgrade) to the latest version.
2. Remove all references to the `shopify app config push` command in any scripts or aliases.
3. When you're ready to deploy both app configuration and all extensions, run the `deploy` command.

$

$

shopify app deploy

4. Shopify CLI will ask if you want to start including app configuration on `deploy`. Answer `Yes, always`, and your choice will be saved in your app configuration file.
5. Continue the rest of the `deploy` flow to release a new app version to users.
6. Push your app configuration file to source control, so all contributors use the same app configuration. This ensures that the app and Shopify CLI commands behave the same way in each contributor's environment.

### [Anchor to Update your CI/CD workflow](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/cli-for-apps/app-configuration#update-your-ci-cd-workflow)Update your CI/CD workflow

If you use the `shopify app config push` with the `--force` flag, follow these steps to migrate to the `deploy` command:

1. [Upgrade Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli#upgrade) to the latest version.
2. Remove all references to the `shopify app config push` command.
3. Add the `deploy` command with the `--force` flag to your workflow, if it's not there already. Refer to the [example workflows](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/launch/deployment/deploy-in-ci-cd-pipeline#examples) for more details.
