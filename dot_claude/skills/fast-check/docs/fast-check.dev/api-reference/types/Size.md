* [Size](https://fast-check.dev/api-reference/types/Size.html)

# Type Alias Size

Size: "xsmall" | "small" | "medium" | "large" | "xlarge"

The size parameter defines how large the generated values could be.

The default in fast-check is 'small' but it could be increased (resp. decreased)
to ask arbitraries for larger (resp. smaller) values.
