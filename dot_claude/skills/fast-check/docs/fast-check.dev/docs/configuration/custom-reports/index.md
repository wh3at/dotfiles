Customize how to report failures.

## Default Report[​](https://fast-check.dev/docs/configuration/custom-reports/index.html#default-report "Direct link to Default Report")

When failing `assert` automatically format the errors for you, with something like:

```
**FAIL**  sort.test.mjs > should sort numeric elements from the smallest to the largest one
Error: Property failed after 1 tests
{ seed: -1819918769, path: "0:...:3", endOnFailure: true }
Counterexample: [[2,1000000000]]
Shrunk 66 time(s)
Got error: AssertionError: expected 1000000000 to be less than or equal to 2
```

While easily redeable, you may want to format it differently. Explaining how you can do that is the aim of this page.

How to read such reports?

If you want to know more concerning how to read such reports, you may refer to the [Read Test Reports](https://fast-check.dev/docs/tutorials/quick-start/read-test-reports/) section of our [Quick Start](https://fast-check.dev/docs/tutorials/quick-start/) tutorial.

## Verbosity[​](https://fast-check.dev/docs/configuration/custom-reports/index.html#verbosity "Direct link to Verbosity")

The simplest and built-in way to change how to format the errors in a different way is verbosity. Verbosity can be either 0, 1 or 2 and is defaulted to 1. It can be changed at `assert`'s level, by passing the option `verbose: <your-value>` to it.

You may refer to [Read Test Reports](https://fast-check.dev/docs/tutorials/quick-start/read-test-reports/#how-to-increase-verbosity) for more details on it.

## New Reporter[​](https://fast-check.dev/docs/configuration/custom-reports/index.html#new-reporter "Direct link to New Reporter")

In some cases you might be interested into fully customizing, extending or even changing what should be a failure or how it should be formated. You can define your own reporting strategy by passing a custom reporter to `assert` as follow:

```
fc.assert(
  // You can either use it with `fc.property`
  // or `fc.asyncProperty`
  fc.property(...),
  {
    reporter(out) {
      // Let's say we want to re-create the default reporter of `assert`
      if (out.failed) {
        // `defaultReportMessage` is an utility that make you able to have the exact
        // same report as the one that would have been generated by `assert`
        throw new Error(fc.defaultReportMessage(out));
      }
    }
  }
)
```

In case your reporter is relying on asynchronous code, you can specify it by setting `asyncReporter` instead of `reporter`.
Contrary to `reporter` that will be used for both synchronous and asynchronous properties, `asyncReporter` is forbidden for synchronous properties and makes them throw.

Before `reporter` and `asyncReporter`

In the past, writing your own reporter would have been done as follow:

```
const throwIfFailed = (out) => {
  if (out.failed) {
    throw new Error(fc.defaultReportMessage(out));
  }
};
const myCustomAssert = (property, parameters) => {
  const out = fc.check(property, parameters);

  if (property.isAsync()) {
    return out.then((runDetails) => {
      throwIfFailed(runDetails);
    });
  }
  throwIfFailed(out);
};
```

## CodeSandbox Reporter[​](https://fast-check.dev/docs/configuration/custom-reports/index.html#codesandbox-reporter "Direct link to CodeSandbox Reporter")

In some situations, it can be useful to directly publish a minimal reproduction of an issue in order to be able to play with it. Custom reporters can be used to provide such capabilities.

For instance, you can automatically generate CodeSandbox environments in case of failed property with the snippet below:

```
import { getParameters } from 'codesandbox/lib/api/define';

const buildCodeSandboxReporter = (createFiles) => {
  return function reporter(runDetails) {
    if (!runDetails.failed) {
      return;
    }
    const counterexample = runDetails.counterexample;
    const originalErrorMessage = fc.defaultReportMessage(runDetails);
    if (counterexample === undefined) {
      throw new Error(originalErrorMessage);
    }
    const files = {
      ...createFiles(counterexample),
      'counterexample.js': {
        content: `export const counterexample = ${fc.stringify(counterexample)}`
      },
      'report.txt': {
        content: originalErrorMessage
      }
    }
    const url = `https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?parameters=${getParameters({ files })}`;
    throw new Error(`${originalErrorMessage}\n\nPlay with the failure here: ${url}`);
  }
}

fc.assert(
  fc.property(...),
  {
    reporter: buildCodeSandboxReporter(counterexample => ({
      'index.js': {
        content: 'console.log("Code to reproduce the issue")'
      }
    }))
  }
)
```

## Customize toString[​](https://fast-check.dev/docs/configuration/custom-reports/index.html#customize-tostring "Direct link to Customize toString")

By default, fast-check serializes generated values using its internal `stringify` helper. Sometimes you may want a better stringified representation of your instances. In such cases, you have several solutions:

1. If your instance defines a `toString` method, it will used to properly report it, unless you've defined one of the following methods, which take precedence.
2. If defining `toString` method is to intrusive, you can use `toStringMethod` and `asyncToStringMethod`.

In most cases, `toStringMethod` is sufficient. This is the serializer method that fast-check uses to serialize your instance in any context: synchronous or asynchronous.

```
Object.defineProperties(myInstanceWithoutCustomToString, {
  [fc.toStringMethod]: { value: () => 'my-value' },
});
// here your instance defines a custom serializer
// that will be used by fast-check whenever needed
```

However, if you're working with asynchronous values, you may need an async method to retrieve the value. For example:

```
Object.defineProperties(myPromisePossiblyResolved, {
  [fc.asyncToStringMethod]: {
    value: async () => {
      const resolved = await myPromisePossiblyResolved;
      return `My value: ${resolved}`;
    },
  },
});
```

Limitations of async variant

Note that:

* `asyncToStringMethod` is only used for asynchronous properties.
* Although `asyncToStringMethod` is marked as asynchronous, it should resolve almost instantly.

Test your custom `toString`

One way to ensure that your instances will be properly stringified is to call the `stringify` function provided by fast-check. This will give you a preview of how your instances will be represented in the output.
